Thomas Claggett, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland and first Episcopal bishop consecrated in the United States, was determined that there should be an Episcopal church in the nation's capital. In 1793, he appointed prominent local businessmen and landed gentry to explore using a lottery to finance building a church there. After that group, including Samuel Blodgett, Uriah Forrest, Benjamin Stoddert, William Deakins, and Anthony Addison, failed to make progress, the bishop pressed on to the Maryland legislature.

The Red River congregation had been pioneered by Thomas Craighead, who, in 1785, was the first minister to serve the Kentucky frontier community from his base in the Nashville, Tennessee area. Craighead, a graduate of the College of New Jersey, (later Princeton University) provided a sharp contrast to the plain-spoken McGready, a graduate of a small “log college” in Pennsylvania led by John McMillan. The latter graduated from the College of New Jersey and was the first Presbyterian to establish a church west of the Alleghenies. The differences between Craighead and McGready were stark: “If Dr. Craighead was more graceful in his manner, polished in his style,” said one man who had heard both men preach, “Mr. McGready was more earnest…and solemn in his appeals to the conscience.”",

Together, these gave a sound far removed from her initial folk roots and much closer to ordinary rock. Indeed, \"Buffy\" was recorded at much the same time and place as \"Quiet Places\" and no label took it up until her last Vanguard recordings had been released.\n\nBuffy (album)\n\nDespite \"Buffy\" commanding a high price tag upon completion, MCA did little to promote it. Very few music magazines ever bothered to review it and \"Buffy\" was out of print as early as 1978.\n\nBuffy (album)\n\nThe album cover caused MCA a public relations problem. Buffy posed with an exposed breast and refused to have it covered or censored. This caused some retailers in the United States, particularly in the Midwestern states, refusing to carry the album.

The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, but as the roe's temperature does not typically reach that level when it is cooked, even cooked roe causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs, but bluegills and channel catfish fed gar eggs in experiments remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish fed the roe were not immune to the toxin, and most died.

The hard ganoid scales of gars are sometimes used to make jewelry whereas the tough skin is used to make such items as lamp shades. Historically, Native Americans used gar scales as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows with gar skin.

Gars comprise seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine waters of eastern North America, Central America and Cuba in the Caribbean, though extinct members of the family were more widespread. Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Gars are sometimes referred to as \"garpike\", but are not closely related to pike, which are in the fish family Esocidae. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (\"Atractosteus spatula\") is the largest; the alligator gar often grows to a length over and a weight over , and specimens of up to in length have been reported. Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans, but gar eggs are highly toxic.",

He failed to give a good and full report to the RGS for many months and thus in effect was not defending his positions of discovery. In addition Speke had a public dispute with the Pethericks who had by and large acted according to their RGS instructions but Speke had felt they had not. All this led Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, to start disliking Speke and a third expedition, led by Speke, was becoming less likely as it would have to be funded by the people Speke was now not on good terms with.

In the rainy season it covers an area larger than England, with a vast humid swamp teeming with mosquitoes and other insects. The only large animals in the Sudd were the crocodiles and hippos that occupied the muddy pools within its vast expanse. Those who entered this region had to endure severe heat and risk disease and starvation. The Sudd was discovered to be too deep to be crossed safely on foot, but its waters were also too shallow to be explored any further by boat. The Romans ‘reached an area where the swamp could only bear a small boat containing one person’. At this point the party despaired of ever finding a definite source for the Nile and turned back reluctantly to report their findings to the emperor in Rome.

Many facets of her existing interests aligned: her fascination with historical and contemporary art, her study of philosophy and sociology, her argumentative nature, her empathy with paint and painters. Over the next year she completed more than 100 short reviews for \"Arts Magazine\". Longer, thought provoking pieces soon became her forte. She loved to chew on an idea, particularly one that had not received much attention, read what others might have written, refute their positions, and then assert her own. She is known for her original, unorthodox criticism; her early career as a painter gave her a unique viewpoint that was strongly sympathetic to artists rather than the critical establishment. After writing about George Sugarman's work, they became devoted friends, correspondents and intellectual sparring partners. Of his work, Goldin wrote: \"Sugarman believes that if a piece of sculpture feels like a thing, even a beautiful thing, it's a failure. He wants a more energetic relationship between the work and the space it creates, for the sake of vivid response. Consequently, he believes that the relationship between one part of the work and another should not seem overtly inevitable and logical, but open and full of possibilities.\"",

         "context": "Land reforms by country\n\nIreland.\n\nAt the 19th century, most of the land in Ireland belonged to large landowners, most of them of English origin. Most of the Irish population were tenants, having few rights and forced to pay high rents. This situation was a contributory factor to the Great Irish Famine of 1845-1852 and the main cause of the Land Wars of 1870s-1890s.\n\nLand reforms by country\n\nThe governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland responded to the agitations in Ireland with a series of land acts, beginning with the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870 (initiated by prime minister William Ewart Gladstone), followed by further five land acts overseen by a Land Commission, prior to independence in 1922, by which time over 90% of lands had transferred from landlords to their former tenant farmers on negotiated terms with funding provided by the UK government.\n\nItaly.\n\nLand reform has been a long-standing and widespread problem before the 20th century, especially in Southern Italy. Despite the vain attempts of the governments to redistribute the land in Southern Italy (the so-called \"Mezzogiorno\"), from the pragmatic decree \"De administratione Universitatum \" (1792) of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies to the law \"Leggi eversive delle feudalità\" (which literally means \"laws abolishing feudalism\") in 1806–1808, enacted by Joseph Bonaparte, the issue remained largely unsolved, mainly because of the strenuous opposition of the great landowners, unwilling to lose their privileges and to allow the emancipation of the peasant class. Even with the Unification of Italy, despite the promises of the abolition of the so-called \"latifondi\" (\"large estates\"), the problem remained unsolved. Southern Italy's big landowners, which had been loyal to the Bourbons until the 1860, actively contributed to the unification of Italy in order to not lose its prestige, and expropriating estates from them would have implied, for the Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946), to have a powerful enemy. Southern Italy's peasants, disappointed and irritated, rebelled and provoked a bloody civil war, known as Post-Unification Brigandage.",

The historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham suggest the settlement's earthwork defences and stone walls resemble an \"enormous outer bailey\" of the castle, rather a more conventional set of town walls. The walled settlement would have formed an important symbol of William's lordship.\n\nCastle Acre Castle and town walls\n\nAs part of these works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had previously run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south had to leave the main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching the southern end of the walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.",

His luxury choices were a piano and a cricket ball.\n\nJim Laker\n\nLaker developed an interest in broadcasting and, after he retired from playing, became a highly regarded cricket commentator for ITV from 1966 to 1968 and for BBC Television from 1968 until his death in 1986. Fellow commentator John Arlott described Laker's commentary style as: \"Wry, dry, laconic, he thought about cricket with a deep intensity and a splendidly ironic point of view\" whilst Colin Cowdrey praised Laker's \"own brand of television commentary\" that made him a respected figure in the medium. Ted Dexter, as a summariser, worked with commentators Laker and Richie Benaud at the BBC and later remarked on how \"a new style of interpretation had evolved as ball-by-ball commentary became their preserve\", their trademarks being \"patience, accuracy and persistence\". The commentary was spoofed in \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" \"Trailer\" sketch in the \"Archaeology Today\" episode in 1970.",

Selznick for whom he worked on \"The Third Man\" (1949) in Vienna, and then on \"Terminal Station\" (1953) in Rome (released in the U.S. as \"Indiscretion of an American Wife\").\n\nPeter de Rome\n\nIn 1956, he emigrated to the U.S. and first joined Tiffany &amp; Company as a salesman, then left in 1963 to work in the Civil Rights Movement in the south with his good friend, actress Madeleine Sherwood. During this period, he made his first movie, a short documentary entitled \"New Orleans\". Returning to New York, he made a succession of gay erotic shorts culminating with \"Hot Pants\", which won a first prize in 1971 at the Wet Dream Film Festival in Amsterdam. This in turn led to a suggestion from producer Jack Deveau to select eight of de Rome's movies to be released commercially as \"The Erotic Films of Peter de Rome\". These shorts opened to critical acclaim at Lincoln Center in NYC, and later ran successfully in most large cities across the U.S.",

Its population is 22,927 (2021).\n\nArdahan\n\nHistory.\n\nAncient and medieval.\n\nArdahan was historically located in the region of Gogarene (Gugark), which Strabo calls a part of the Armenia that was taken away from the Kingdom of Iberia. In the Middle Ages Ardahan served as an important transit point for goods arriving from the Abbasid Caliphate and departing to the regions around the Black Sea. During the 8th to 10th centuries the region was in hands of the Bagrationi princes of Tao-Klarjeti under the name of Artaani, and later part of Kingdom of Georgia between 11th to 15th centuries. According to the Arab historian Yahya of Antioch, the Byzantines razed Ardahan and slaughtered its population in 1021.\n\nArdahan\n\nThe Mongols took hold of the city in the 1230s but the Georgian princes of Samtskhe were able to recapture it in 1266. In 1555, by the Peace of Amasya, the western part of the principality of Samtskhe was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, and Ardahan was included into the \"sanjak\" of Ardahan (an overall part of the \"vilayet\" of Akhaltsikhe). The Ottomans turned Ardahan into a formidable fortress-town. In the 1640s the Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Ardahan and gave the following description: \"The fortress of Ardahan sits atop an inaccessible cliff. It is square-shaped and sturdy... This fortress has a cold climate and, because of this, there are no gardens or orchards. Fruits arrive from the fortress at Ajara and Tortum.\"",

In 1578 Ottomans appointed the former Georgian prince, Manuchar (who took the name of \"Mustafa\" after converting to Islam) as the first governor. From 1625 onwards the entire eyalet was a hereditary possession of the now-Muslim atabegs of Samtskhe, which administered it as hereditary governors, with some exceptions, until the mid-18th century.",

The name of the village, \"Bessenovo\", originated from an earlier settlement by the Pechenegs. It was first documented in the papal tithes in 1332. In 1551, the Ottomans entered Banat. The occupation only ended when Prince Eugene of Savoy and the Austrian troops took Timișoara on 13 October 1756. By now the whole area had become depopulated, impoverished and marshy. In the Treaty of Passarowitz the Banat of Temeswar was subordinated to the \"Hofkammer\" in Vienna as crown land of the Kaiser on 21 July 1718. Count Claude Florimond de Mercy was assigned in 1720 with the administration, reclamation and governance of Banat. Initially he recruited immigrants predominantly from his native country Lorraine for the province entrusted in his care. The Lorrainian Johann Oßwald, living in Banat since 20 years already, recruited 60 German-Lorrainian families (290 people) from the areas around Mainz and Trier to settle in Beschenowa. In 1748, as part of the \"Große Schwabenwanderungen\" (Great Swabian Migrations) of the Danube Swabians, this first group of voluntary imperial colonists arrived, most of which came on floats called Ulmer Schachtel, traveling on the Danube from the German town of Ulm for about two or three weeks. In 1750 another group of settlers arrived. The name of \"Neubeschenowa\" was adopted to distinguish the village from \"Altbeschenowa\", present-day Dudeștii Vechi, also located in Banat. Following the unrests by the Salpeters in the shire of Hauenstein, Schwarzwald, several families were deported by force and resettled in Neubeschenowa. Several decommissioned soldiers also settled in the community in 1763. The family of Habsburg-Lorraine signed over politically the Banat of Temeswar to Hungary in 1778.",

The announcement of the 2004 version came as an unpleasant surprise to Cook and some of his fans, who believed that they had an understanding with Wizards of the Coast that this title would not be re-used in the near future.\n\nArcana Unearthed\n\nReception.\n\n\"Arcana Unearthed\" won the 2004 Gold ENnie Award for Best Game, and the Silver for Best Art (Cover).\n\nThe cover, by artist Mark Zug, won the Chesley Award for Best Gaming-Related Illustration in 2005.\n\nArcana Evolved.\n\n\"Arcana Evolved\" is an updated \"director's cut\" of \"Arcana Unearthed\" released in 2005. \"Arcana Evolved\" is 432 pages in full color. It adds the contents of two previously separate books, \"The Diamond Throne\" and the \"Player's Companion\", to the original variant player's handbook, along with new material including a new class and race, many new feats and spells, and rules for higher level characters than were possible in the original book. On the less mechanical side, it also advances the time line of the Diamond Throne campaign setting by several years - years which feature the return of dragons to the lands of the Diamond Throne, reviving an ancient rivalry with the ruling giants.",

Listed on the Record of Protected Structures for County Mayo, it is a 30-foot structure rising from a series of steps from the base nearly 40 feet in width. John Kilmaine of Alcester, England provides the following information on the structure: \"It is said that the pyramid is constructed on the old tumulus. The building of the pyramid is attributed to Sir John Browne the 7th Baronet and 1st Baron of Kilmaine, in memory of his brother, Sir George Browne. The structure, which at one time was crowned by a lead figure of Apollo, was designed by the Earl of Charlemont for his brother in law, Sir John Browne, The Neale\". There are a few varying stories of the building of the Pyramid. One such story is that Lord Kilmaine was anxious to find a way of relieving the extreme poverty of his tenants in the post famine years, so he employed several men to pick up the stones around the estate. He had those stones piled up and built into a pyramid. This provided the poor people with a little additional income. In the later years a wind-vane adorned the top of the pyramid, so the landlord could indulge in his passion for meteorology and the recording of weather systems over a period of 30 years. The Office of Public Works refurbished the Pyramid in 1990.",

I'm a different kind of feminist. I'm a bad feminist'\".

The same year, commemorating the International Women's Day, she released a 12-minute short film called \"Her Story\" and which was dedicated \"to all women that fight for freedom\" and highlighted the fight for gender equality. The short clip ends with two figures carrying a banner that reads \"we should all be feminists\". Also, during that year Madonna was one of dozens of celebrities who attended the Women's March in Washington D.C. singing \"Express Yourself\" and \"Human Nature\". In 2018, Madonna proclaimed her solidarity with the Ele Não movement. In 2019, she talked about the MeToo movement.",

In premodern Japan, strict sumptuary laws were enacted by the Shogunate, which forbade farmers from wearing certain textiles such as silk, and colours such as purple, crimson, and plum-coloured dyes. However, one of the colours allowed was dark blue. Subsequently, rural workers began to be associated with blue clothing. While it does differ depending on region, traditionally the blue dye is contrasted with regular white geometric designs. Stripes are also used, although this pattern is considered one of the most complicated to weave. Also, there is slight variation between the stripes men and women would wear; men's stripes were woven in very narrow stripes, whereas women's stripes were wider and not so regular in spacing. Since the Taisho period (1912-1926) monpe have been made using more adventurous and brighter colour palettes, such as orange and purple, although even today indigo blue continues to be the most common.",

Louis was moved to a private residence in Mansurah and the Crusader leaders were kept together in a larger prison. While they were threatened with death, their value for ransom allowed them to stay alive. Jean de Joinville, on-board one of the captured ships, saved his life by claiming to be the king’s cousin. It was later revealed that he was actually the emperor's cousin, which served him well as the prestige of Frederick II among the Egyptians was a plus. When Louis was ordered by the sultan to cede not only Damietta but all the Frankish lands in Syria, he noted that they were not under his control, but rather that of Conrad II of Jerusalem, the emperor’s son. The demand was quickly dropped. The final terms exacted from Louis were harsh. He was to ransom himself by the surrender of Damietta and his army by the payment of a million bezants (later reduced to 800,000). After the terms were agreed to, the king and the barons were taken down the river to Fariskur, where the sultan had taken residence.

Game 2 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was originally scheduled for Friday, May 5. However, due to the NBA's Miami Heat's home game against the New York Knicks along with the 2023 Miami Grand Prix, Game 3 of Florida–Toronto was moved from Saturday, May 6 to Sunday, May 7, leaving the traditional \"Hockey Night in Canada\" timeslot available. Thus, Game 2 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was moved to Saturday, May 6, while a tripleheader of the other three series was held on Sunday, May 7. This left several Edmonton fans to suffer cancelation\/rescheduling fees for flights and tickets as they were not initially aware of the NHL schedule change. As a result, Game 6 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was moved to Sunday, May 14; despite this being the lone game on that day, its start time was pushed to 10:00 p.m. ET so ESPN could air it after \"Sunday Night Baseball\".",

It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south and borders Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia and Kosovo to the northeast, Albania to the southeast. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the \"Prijestonica\" (meaning the old royal capital or former seat of the throne).\n\nOutline of Montenegro\n\nThe thousand-year history of the Montenegrin state begins in the 9th century with the emergence of Duklja, a vassal state of Byzantium. In those formative years, Duklja was ruled by the Vojislavljevic dynasty. In 1042, at the end of his 25-year rule, King Vojislav won a decisive battle near Bar against Byzantium, and Duklja became independent. Duklja's power and prosperity reached their zenith under King Vojislav's son, King Mihailo (1046–81), and his son King Bodin (1081–1101). From the 11th century, it started to be referred to as Zeta. It ended with its incorporation into Serbia in the late 1180s. Beginning with the Crnojević dynasty (late 15th century), Upper Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora or by the Venetian term \"\". A sovereign principality since the Late Middle Ages, Montenegro saw its independence from the Ottoman Empire formally recognized in 1878. From 1918, it was a part of various incarnations of Yugoslavia. On the basis of a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence on 3 June. On 28 June 2006, it became the 192nd member state of the United Nations, and on 11 May 2007 the 47th member state of the Council of Europe. On 15 December 2008, Montenegro presented its official application to the European Union, with the hopes of gaining EU candidate status by 2009.",

As elsewhere in the Balkans, Slavs mixed with the Roman population of these Byzantine coastal cities. The Theme of Dalmatia was established in the 870s.

The Kingdom of Vannius, a barbarian kingdom founded by the Quadi, existed in western and central Slovakia from 20 to 50 AD. The Romans and their armies occupied only a thin strip of the right bank of the Danube and a very small part of south-western Slovakia (Celemantia, Gerulata, Devín Castle).\n\nHistory of Slovakia before the Slovaks\n\nOnly in 174 CE did the emperor Marcus Aurelius penetrate deeper into the river valleys of Váh, Nitra and Hron. On the banks of the Hron he wrote his philosophical work \"Meditations\". In 179 CE, a Roman legion engraved on the rock of the Trenčín Castle the ancient name of Trenčín (\"Laugaritio\"), marking the furthest northern point of their presence in this part of Europe.\n\nHistory of Slovakia before the Slovaks\n\nThe great invasions of the 4–8th centuries.\n\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE the Huns began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377 CE and occupied Pannonia, which they used for 75 years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. In 451, under the command of Attila, they crossed the Rhine and laid Gaul to waste; then crossed even the Pyrenees, devastating the countryside of Catalonia.

In the immediate aftermath of the Mussolini years and the unpopular concurrent war with which they had come to be identified, Ojetti was representative of a period from which newly mainstream intellectuals were keen to move on. In 1925 Ojetti was one of those who added his signature to Giovanni Gentile’s so-called Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals, indicating a wish to remain a member of Italy’s literary establishment under the new regime. Nomination in 1930 to the recently created Royal Academy indicated full acceptance by the post-1922 ruling establishment.\n\nUgo Ojetti\n\nBetween 1925 and 1933 Ojetti served as a member of the Executive Board for the newly inaugurated Enciclopedia Italiana, of which the initial tranche of volumes was published progressively between 1929 and 1936, taking a vital role till 1929 as coordinator of the compendium’s arts section. Through this period he was, in addition, organising numerous art exhibitions as well as injecting his own magic into various publishing initiatives such as, notably, the series “Le più belle pagine degli scrittori italiani scelte da scrittori viventi” (‘’loosely, “The finest pages from Italian writers, selected by living writers”’’), published by , and the series of “Italian classics”.",

It is somewhat understudied and lacks a conservation status, but it is present in a region that is the subject of an ecological restoration project - the Jequitinhonha River. Specifics of diet and behavior are unknown, though shoaling activity has been observed in laboratory conditions.\n\nAstyanax brevirhinus\n\nThe species name \"brevirhinus\" means \"short nose\"; this is because \"A. brevirhinus\" can be told apart from several congeners by its abbreviated snout length. Other factors, such as a lateral stripe and horizontal humeral spot, are shared with other \"Astyanax\" species, but aspects of dentition and fin structure can be used to differentiate. Nonetheless, these and other aspects - such as the deep body and silver scales - are not uncommon features within Astyanax as a whole.\n\nAstyanax brevirhinus\n\nTaxonomy.\n\nAstyanax brevirhinus was first cataloged by prolific German-American ichthyologist Carl H. Eigenmann in 1908. The type specimen, however, was collected much earlier; the Thayer expedition to Brazil, an ecological and biological endeavor undertaken by multiple scientists, took place in 1865, and resulted in various type specimens that were later recognized as new species by those that had attended. (Another example is a congener of \"A. brevirhinus\", \"Astyanax bourgeti\".) The original description of \"A. brevirhinus\" was somewhat brief, but it received a more detailed update from Eigenmann in the 1921 volume of \"The American Characidae\", a series of articles published in the journal \"Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College\" and later compiled into a book.",

For the next two centuries, the rich farmland of the south and the military theaters of the north were linked almost solely by the Jinghang Canal. Bribery and disinterest occasionally permitted more leeway, as when the Portuguese began trading at Guangzhou (1517), Shuangyu (\"Liampo\"), and Quanzhou (\"Chincheu\"), but crackdowns also occurred, as with the expulsion of the Portuguese in the 1520s, on the islands off Ningbo and Zhangzhou in 1547, or at Yuegang in 1549.

Local authorities themselves were frequently involved in the illicit trade, and usually ignored edicts to restrict trade. Military officers brokered trade deals and the wealthy families in the coastal settlements depended on its income. Ordinary workers found employment in trade-related industries. Many of the official posts to enforce trade regulations were left vacant and the Maritime Trading Intendancies were abolished. The court generally ignored the issue of overseas trade. In the 1520s the emperor rejected all attempts to halt the trade as these came from officials who had opposed the emperor's policy of rituals, and very little trade took place under governmental channels instead of illicit means. The Grand secretary of the court in the 1530s was from coastal Zhejiang province, and he proceeded to block any attempt to enforce the sea ban. The most significant attempt to crush out the illicit trade was made by Zhu Wan, an official appointed by the court in the 1540s, but just as he was making headway in wiping out the smugglers he was removed by the court on accusations of unauthorised killings.",

On November 28 the Montreal city council voted in favour (40–22) of renaming Park Avenue after Bourassa. If, as had been expected, Quebec's Toponymy Commission had approved the name change, all of Park Avenue and its continuation, Bleury, would have been renamed Robert Bourassa Avenue. This would have caused the newly named street to intersect René Lévesque Boulevard, named after a long time political rival to Bourassa. That boulevard, in turn, had been renamed from Dorchester Boulevard in 1987, in a decision that was also not without controversy. This decision by the City of Montreal without any consultation with the people of the city caused an immediate controversy, though many of those opposed to the change considered it a \"fait accompli\". The proposal spawned substantial grass-roots opposition, both because of the lack of prior citizen input and because Park is itself a meaningful street name, associated with the city's Mount Royal park. In addition to protests and active opposition by a committee of Montreal residents and businesses opposed to the name change, an online petition garnered more than 18,000 virtual signatures against this renaming. On February 5, 2007, Montreal mayor Gérald Tremblay withdrew his proposal to rename Park Avenue. However, there is a Robert Bourassa Blvd., located in the Duvernay district of Laval, Quebec.",

In Handsworth near Sheffield, he began producing steel in 1740 after years of experimenting in secret. Huntsman's system used a coke-fired furnace capable of reaching 1,600 °C, into which up to twelve clay crucibles, each capable of holding about 15 kg of iron, were placed. When the crucibles or \"pots\" were white-hot, they were charged with lumps of blister steel, an alloy of iron and carbon produced by the cementation process, and a flux to help remove impurities. The pots were removed after about 3 hours in the furnace, impurities in the form of slag skimmed off, and the molten steel poured into moulds to end up as cast ingots. Complete melting of the steel produced a highly uniform crystal structure upon cooling, which gave the metal increased tensile strength and hardness in comparison with other steels being made at the time.\n\nCrucible steel\n\nBefore the introduction of Huntsman's technique, Sheffield produced about 200 tonnes of steel per year from Swedish wrought iron (see Oregrounds iron). The introduction of Huntsman's technique changed this radically: one hundred years later the amount had risen to over 80,000 tonnes per year, or almost half of Europe's total production. Sheffield developed from a small township into one of Europe's leading industrial cities.",

By the 14th century Sheffield was noted for the production of knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.",

At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.",

His father traced his lineage to the medieval Kings of Leinster through Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh. He had two older brothers Charles and Thomas, and one sister, Harriet or \"Hoddy.\" Arthur Kavanagh was born with only the rudiments of arms and legs, though the cause of this birth defect is unknown.\n\nArthur MacMurrough Kavanagh\n\nHis mother insisted that he be brought up and have opportunities like any other child and placed him in the care of the doctor Francis Boxwell, who believed that an armless and legless child could live a productive life. Kavanagh learnt to ride horses at the age of three by being strapped to a special saddle and managing the horse with the stumps of his arms. With the help of the surgeon Sir Philip Crampton, Lady Harriet had a mechanical wheelchair constructed for her son, and encouraged him to ride horses and engage in other outdoor activities. He also went fishing, hunted animals, drew pictures, and wrote stories, with mechanical devices supplementing his physical capacities. His mother taught him how to write and paint holding pens and brushes in his mouth.",

His body was thrown into the stream near the waterfall. The following day, 20 August 1975, a group of eight men, who were being detained by Fretilin in Fatisi on suspicion of being spies for the Timorese Democratic Union ( (UDT)), were taken outside.

However, the Rams — and Warner in particular — lit up defenses throughout the league. Warner threw 41 touchdown passes, setting a new franchise mark, and his 109.2 quarterback rating was the third highest (for a minimum of 200 attempts) in a season next to Joe Montana (112.4) and Steve Young (112.8).

Offensive coordinator Mike Martz's innovative variation on the Coryell offensive system suited Warner well; he threw only 13 interceptions during the regular season. For his innovation, Martz would be regarded as one of the most ingenious coordinators of his time. The Rams first demolished the Minnesota Vikings in in a shoot-out, where Warner burned the Minnesota secondary for 391 yards and five touchdowns en route to victory. In , the Rams faced the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, coached by Tony Dungy. Facing one of the league's best defenses, Warner had one of the worst postseason performances of his career, throwing three interceptions to the heavily loaded Buccaneers secondary which featured John Lynch, Donnie Abraham, and Ronde Barber. However, the Rams proved they were more than just a good offensive team, as they prevented Tampa Bay from scoring any touchdowns, allowed only two field goals, and intercepted Shaun King twice. Trailing 6–5 late in the 4th quarter, Warner engineered the game-winning drive culminating in the go-ahead touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl to send the Rams to the Super Bowl with an 11–6 victory.",

When the articles were collected and published in book form in 1972, it became a bestseller nationally and gained attention for the Foxfire project.\n\nFoxfire (magazine)\n\nThe magazine was named for foxfire, a term for a naturally occurring bioluminescence in fungi in the forests of North Georgia. In 1977, the Foxfire project moved from the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School to the newly built and consolidated public Rabun County High School. Additional books were published, and with profits from magazine and book sales, the students created a not-for-profit educational and literary organization and a museum.

Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as \"Rich Man, Poor Man\"; \"Fawlty Towers\", \"Forsyte Saga\", \"Elizabeth R\", \"I, Claudius\", \"I'll Take Manhattan\", and \"Peter the Great\".",

The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize sidebar menus and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open.

Joining his brother in the team, Marinko made his senior debut for West Perth against East Fremantle in round one of the 1954 season, having replaced the injured Brian Falconer. He played a total of 22 games in his first season, alternating between centre and the half-back and half-forward flanks. Marinko was known for his exceptional footpassing, with \"The West Australian\" noting that his main attribute was \"accurate kicking with either foot\". Having established himself as a regular in West Perth's senior side, he was also strong overhead, with a spectacular mark over East Fremantle's Ray French during the 1956 season said to be equal to John Gerovich's famous mark over the same player, although no documentary evidence of the mark has survived.",

         "context": "Upper Canada\n\nRyerson and the Methodists.\n\nThe undisputed leader of the highly fractious Methodists in Upper Canada was Egerton Ryerson, editor of their newspaper, \"The Christian Guardian\". Ryerson (1803–1882) was an itinerant minister – or circuit rider – in the Niagara area for the Methodist Episcopal Church – an American branch of Methodism. As British immigration increased, Methodism in Upper Canada was torn between those with ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church and the British Wesleyan Methodists. Ryerson used the \"Christian Guardian\" to argue for the rights of Methodists in the province and, later, to help convince rank-and-file Methodists that a merger with British Wesleyans (effected in 1833) was in their best interest.\n\nUpper Canada\n\nPresbyterians.\n\nThe earliest Presbyterian ministers in Upper Canada came from various denominations based in Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. The \"Presbytery of the Canadas\" was formed in 1818 primarily by Scottish Associate Presbyterian missionaries, yet independently of their mother denomination in the hope of including Presbyterian ministers of all stripes in Upper and Lower Canada. Although successfully including members from Irish Associate, and American Presbyterian and Reformed denominations, the growing group of missionaries belonging to the Church of Scotland remained separate. Instead, in 1831, they formed their own \"Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in Connection with the Established Church of Scotland\". That same year the \"Presbytery of the Canadas\", having grown and been re-organized, became the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\". In its continued pursuit for Presbyterian unity (and a share of government funding from the clergy reserves for established churches) the United Synod sought a union with the Church of Scotland synod which it finally joined in 1840. However, some ministers had left the United Synod prior to this merger (including, notably, Rev. James Harris, Rev. William Jenkins, and Rev. Daniel Eastman). In the 1832 new Secessionist missionaries began to arrive, belonging to \"The United Associate Synod in Scotland\" (after 1847, the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland). Committed to the voluntarist principle of rejecting government funding they decided against joining the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\" and on Christmas Day 1834 formed the \"Missionary Presbytery of the Canadas\". Although this new presbytery was formed at Rev. James Harris's church in Toronto, he and his congregation remained independent from it. However, the voluntarist, Rev. Jenkins and his congregation in Richmond Hill joined the Missionary Presbytery a few years later. Rev. Eastman had left the United Synod in 1833 to form the \"Niagara Presbytery\" of the Presbyterian Church in the USA. After this presbytery dissolved following the Rebellion of 1837, he rejoined the United Synod which then joined the Church of Scotland. Outside of these four Presbyterian denominations, only two others gained a foothold in the province. The small \"Stamford Presbytery\" of the American Secessionist tradition was formed in 1835 in the Niagara region, and the Scottish Reformed Presbyterian or \"Covenanter\" tradition was represented in the province to an even lesser extent. Despite the numerous denominations, by the late 1830s, the Church of Scotland was the main expression of Presbyterianism in Upper Canada.",

The oldest are original Portuguese and Spanish Colonial architecture; followed after independences in the Americas from Spain and Portugal, by the Spanish Colonial Revival style with regional variations.

Little is known of Clerk's parentage and childhood other than his parents were Jamaican Christians. He was the third son among five brothers and four sisters. In 1833, when Alexander Clerk was about thirteen years old, the \"apprenticeship act\", granting immediate and full freedom to children six years of age and younger, and an intermediate status for those older, was enacted. Between 1838 and 1842, Clerk studied Christian theology, ministry, dogmatics and homiletics; philosophy and ethics; pedagogy and education at the now defunct \"Fairfield Teachers’ Seminary (Lehrerseminar Fairfield),\" a teachers' training college and theological seminary, founded in 1837 by the Rev. Jacob Zorn (1803 – 1843), a German-speaking Danish subject and a superintendent of the Moravian Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands from 1834 until his death in 1843. Zorn was also a missionary of the London-based \"Missions of the Church of the United Brethren\" and its sister organisation, \"The Brethren’s Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel\". The Jamaican branch of the Moravian Church, which had its early beginnings in 1754, had by then been in the West Indies for nearly hundred years. The first Moravian missionaries in Jamaica were Zecharias Georg Caries, Thomas Shallcross and Gottlieb Haberecht, who evangelised to slaves on the \"Bogue Estate\" and later, to surrounding plantations. As part of his classical education, Clerk also studied languages: German, Latin, Greek and Hebrew. The training institute was established by Zorn at the behest of the Moravian mission leadership to prepare young Jamaican men for Christian evangelism, catechism and the propagation of the Gospel in the West Indies after the abolishment of slavery in the British Empire in 1834 followed by the full emancipation of slaves in Jamaica on 1 August 1838, a little over a year after Queen Victoria's ascension to the throne. Zorn also envisioned sending graduates from his small missionary training school to evangelical mission in Africa. Clerk was also mentored by the Rev. J. Blandfield at the Moravian school. Clerk's education was funded by a wealthy Victorian Christian woman from Bath, Somerset, Mrs. P. Skeate (née Ibbett) . A. W. Clerk maintained correspondence with his English benefactor when he later worked on the Gold Coast as a teacher-missionary. Clerk was set to become a teacher-catechist and a missionary affiliated to the Fairfield Moravian Church mission presbytery or classis, (founded on 1 January 1826) after his graduation from the seminary and subsequent consecration as a missionary in 1842.",

As he had no field pieces, the only possibility was to attempt storming the fort by surprise. On that day, Fort Bull was occupied by 25 soldiers of 50th (Shirley's) Regiment plus 34 carpenters, boatmen and carters together with three women. At about 11 am, the French and Indians began to approach Fort Bull silently when the Indians gave a war cry that alerted the British. Léry asked that the Iroquois refrain from their \"horrendous war cries\" that were meant to strike terror in the heart of the enemy in order to take the British by surprise, but at about 900 feet (275 m) away from Fort Bull, the Iroquois gave their customary war cries. Seeing the British were alerted, the French shouted \"Vive le roi\n\nBattle of Fort Bull\n\nThe attackers managed to fire through loopholes in the fort's walls to distract the garrison, which responded by throwing rocks and grenades over the walls. The French and the Indians fired through the loopholes, trapping much of the garrison within the buildings while the militiamen tried to chop their way in through the wooden walls with tomahawks and the \"troupes de la Marine\" used their axes to try to smash their way in through the main gate. The tomahawks proved ineffective at smashing through the gate, and Léry in his report mentioned smashing his way in with \"à coup de haches\" (\"by ax blows\"), suggesting that heavy axes were used. Speaking through an interpreter, Léry demanded that the fort surrender, but he reported that \"the fire of the enemy became livelier and more determined\". Léry wrote Bull's defense was conducted \"with all the possible bravery and intrepidity that I have always remarked of with English officers\". Collière, the Iroquois chief was killed by a British bullet going through his head fired by Colonel Bull. After Bull refused several calls to surrender, the gate was smashed down at about noon by using a fallen tree trunk as a battering ram, and the attackers stormed into the fort. Ignoring the ineffective British musket fire, the French charged forward and used their bayonets and tomahawks to cut down any British soldier in their path as they raced throughout the fort. One of the Iroquois warriors avenged Collière's death by using his tomahawk to smash in Bull's head. The wife of Bull was killed by an Iroquois warrior who smashed in her face with his tomahawk, scalped her, and accidentally caused a fire when he tossed her corpse into a fire, pulled her corpse out with a burning skirt that according to the French \"set fire to the house\".",

During Jerry's senior year, Charles Harder, chairman of the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, was the invited guest juror of the senior art exhibition at Wayne. Impressed by Jerry's work, he offered him a place in the Alfred graduate program.

His studio pottery, comprising both functional pieces and sculptural forms, has appeared in gallery and museum exhibitions.\n\nJerome and Evelyn Ackerman\n\nJerry died on March 30, 2019, in Culver City, California, at the age of 99.\n\nEvelyn Ackerman.\n\nEvelyn Ackerman was born on January 12, 1924, in Detroit, Michigan to Jacob Lipchinsky (later changed to Lipton) and Sara Turetsky. Evelyn graduated from Central High School in 1941, and began at the University of Michigan as an art major. Then, in 1942, her father died and her three brothers entered the military. With her mother in need of help, she transferred to Wayne University as a fine arts and art history major. There she was introduced to the German Expressionists, Rembrandt, Cézanne, Klee, and Matisse by her art history professor, Dr. Ernst Scheyer. After completing her BFA degree with distinction in 1945, Evelyn completed her MFA degree in fine arts in 1950.",

         "context": "Sequent calculus\n\nGentzen-style systems have significant practical and theoretical advantages compared to Hilbert-style systems. For example, both natural deduction and sequent calculus systems facilitate the elimination and introduction of universal and existential quantifiers so that unquantified logical expressions can be manipulated according to the much simpler rules of propositional calculus. In a typical argument, quantifiers are eliminated, then propositional calculus is applied to unquantified expressions (which typically contain free variables), and then the quantifiers are reintroduced. This very much parallels the way in which mathematical proofs are carried out in practice by mathematicians. Predicate calculus proofs are generally much easier to discover with this approach, and are often shorter. Natural deduction systems are more suited to practical theorem-proving. Sequent calculus systems are more suited to theoretical analysis.\n\nSequent calculus\n\nOverview.\n\nIn proof theory and mathematical logic, sequent calculus is a family of formal systems sharing a certain style of inference and certain formal properties. The first sequent calculi systems, LK and LJ, were introduced in 1934\/1935 by Gerhard Gentzen as a tool for studying natural deduction in first-order logic (in classical and intuitionistic versions, respectively). Gentzen's so-called \"Main Theorem\" (\"Hauptsatz\") about LK and LJ was the cut-elimination theorem, a result with far-reaching meta-theoretic consequences, including consistency. Gentzen further demonstrated the power and flexibility of this technique a few years later, applying a cut-elimination argument to give a (transfinite) proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic, in surprising response to Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Since this early work, sequent calculi, also called Gentzen systems, and the general concepts relating to them, have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic, and automated deduction.",

The definition is slightly more complex: we say the analytic proofs are the normal forms, which are related to the notion of normal form in term rewriting. More exotic proof calculi such as Jean-Yves Girard's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof.\n\nProof theory\n\nA particular family of analytic proofs arising in reductive logic are focused proofs which characterise a large family of goal-directed proof-search procedures. The ability to transform a proof system into a focused form is a good indication of its syntactic quality, in a manner similar to how admissibility of cut shows that a proof system is syntactically consistent.\n\nProof theory\n\nStructural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the Curry–Howard correspondence, which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus. This provides the foundation for the intuitionistic type theory developed by Per Martin-Löf, and is often extended to a three way correspondence, the third leg of which are the cartesian closed categories.",

Chantel Guertin named her 2013 chick lit novel, balancing relationships, yoga, and cosmetic surgery \"Stuck in Downward Dog\", while the yoga teacher and author Tracy Weber named her series of crime novels \"The Downward Dog Mysteries\". \"Texas Monthly\" used the name for its review of the downfall of the Anusara Yoga founder, John Friend.

In doing so, he committed a great injustice to his former commander's memory by magnifying his faults and frequently distorting the historical record. In the wake of the resumed fighting between France and Britain, Péron also drafted a secret \"Mémoire sur les établissements anglais à la Nouvelle Hollande\", which advocated a French conquest of Port Jackson with the aid of rebellious Irish convicts.\n\nFrançois Péron\n\nPéron died of tuberculosis in his hometown of Cérilly in 1810.

Other major films of the period include \"Love and Duty\" (1931), \"Little Toys\" (1933), \"New Women\" (1934), \"Song of the Fishermen\" (1934), \"Plunder of Peach and Plum\" (1934), \"Crossroads\" (1937), and \"Street Angel\" (1937).

All production companies except Xinhua Film Company (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to Hong Kong, the wartime Nationalist capital Chongqing, and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"Solitary Island\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director Bu Wancang's \"Hua Mu Lan\", also known as \"Mulan Joins the Army\" (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war. This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on 7 December 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere-promoting \"Eternity\" (1943) were produced. At the end of World War II, one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized companies, Manchukuo Film Association, would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.",

An experimental blend of comedy and tragedy, Yuan's story followed a group of young friends whose lack of financial means and social status frustrated their dreams of happiness, including a girl singer, her prostitute sister, and her soldier lover, home briefly between fighting the Japanese occupying north China. The film, released shortly before Japan invaded Shanghai and initiated the Second Sino-Japanese War in summer 1937, became a massive hit with audiences. Subsequently, \"Street Angel\" was seen to mark one of the last products of the \"golden age of Chinese cinema\" of the 1930s, before artists were forced to retreat to Shanghai's foreign concessions and finally came under Japanese propaganda control.",

After the Chinese Communist Revolution, domestic films that were already released and a selection of foreign films were banned in 1951, marking a tirade of film censorship in China. Despite this, movie attendance increased sharply. During the Cultural Revolution, the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the \"scar dramas\" of the 1980s, such as \"Evening Rain\" (1980), \"Legend of Tianyun Mountain\" (1980) and \"Hibiscus Town\" (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as \"One and Eight\" (1983) and \"Yellow Earth\" (1984), the rise of the Fifth Generation brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences. Films like \"Red Sorghum\" (1987), \"The Story of Qiu Ju\" (1992) and \"Farewell My Concubine\" (1993) won major international awards. The movement partially ended after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system which played mostly on the international film festival circuit.",
