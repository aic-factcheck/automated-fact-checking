Of the ten constituencies that Survation predicted UKIP would win, Boston and Skegness had the largest predicted UKIP majority. UKIP performed strongly in and near the town of Boston, which was historically a safe Conservative area; this was seen as a surprise and was attributed to voters being concerned about immigration and feeling ignored by politicians. Afterwards, there was some media speculation that Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, might stand in the constituency at the next general election; Simmonds said he \"would be delighted\" if Farage did, as it would give issues in the constituency more attention.\n\nBoston and Skegness (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nIn the 2014 European Parliament election, which UKIP won ahead of Labour and the Conservatives, the Borough of Boston had the highest UKIP vote share in the country.

In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.\n\nCodex Sinaiticus\n\nIn 1853, Tischendorf revisited the Saint Catherine's Monastery to get the remaining 86 folios, but without success. Returning in 1859, this time under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, he was shown Codex Sinaiticus. He would later claim to have found it discarded in a rubbish bin. (This story may have been a fabrication, or the manuscripts in question may have been unrelated to Codex Sinaiticus: Rev. J. Silvester Davies in 1863 quoted \"a monk of Sinai who... stated that according to the librarian of the monastery the whole of Codex Sinaiticus had been in the library for many years and was marked in the ancient catalogues... Is it not likely... that a manuscript known in the library catalogue would have been jettisoned in the rubbish basket.\" Indeed, it has been noted that the leaves were in \"suspiciously good condition\" for something found in the trash.) Tischendorf had been sent to search for manuscripts by Russia's Tsar Alexander II, who was convinced there were still manuscripts to be found at the Sinai monastery. The text of this part of the codex was published by Tischendorf in 1862:",

Wettstein (for works published 1751-1752) employed readings from the codex, but with quite a large number of errors. Biblical scholar Johann M. A. Scholz valued it very highly, and he collated its text and noted its textual variants in 1820, but with so little care and numerous errors that his list is now ignored. Textual critic Constantin von Tischendorf produced a new collation in 1842, with Tregelles producing another independent collation in 1849, and in 1850 they compared their collations in Leipzig, and created a new list.

Gars comprise seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine waters of eastern North America, Central America and Cuba in the Caribbean, though extinct members of the family were more widespread. Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Gars are sometimes referred to as \"garpike\", but are not closely related to pike, which are in the fish family Esocidae. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (\"Atractosteus spatula\") is the largest; the alligator gar often grows to a length over and a weight over , and specimens of up to in length have been reported. Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans, but gar eggs are highly toxic.",

The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, but as the roe's temperature does not typically reach that level when it is cooked, even cooked roe causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs, but bluegills and channel catfish fed gar eggs in experiments remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish fed the roe were not immune to the toxin, and most died. The roe's toxicities to humans and crayfish may be coincidences, however, and not the result of explicit natural selection.\n\nGar\n\nSignificance to humans.\n\nSeveral species are traded as aquarium fish. The hard ganoid scales of gars are sometimes used to make jewelry whereas the tough skin is used to make such items as lamp shades. Historically, Native Americans used gar scales as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows with gar skin. Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture other than the ritual \"garfish dances\" that have been performed by Creek and Chickasaw tribes.",

The temperature greatly affects their moving rates and their ability to range their home turf. When the water is warmer during the spring and summer, they travel more often than during the cold seasons. Spotted gars eat 70% of their food intake at night compared to dusk and dawn.[3]\n\nSpotted gar\n\nAbiotic factors that affect the spotted gar by humans include destruction of habitat and increased sedimentation in the water. In 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, in coordination with the US Environmental Protection Agency, took fish tissue samples in the Lower Mississippi River to test for heavy metals and organic compounds.[4] Spotted gar was found to be a cancer risk with high concentrations of heavy metals and organic compounds.[4]",

After passing Lane Manor Recreation Center, the state highway leaves the commercial area and crosses Northwest Branch. Here the highway reduces to four lanes. MD 193 continues east through a forested area toward College Park. Campus Drive continues straight toward the University of Maryland campus as well as University of Maryland Global Campus, while MD 193 veers left and intersects Adelphi Road. Movements between MD 193 east and Adelphi Road south are made via Campus Drive. After passing Adelphi Road, the state highway heads northeast past the intersection with Stadium Drive, which is used to access Maryland Stadium and the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center. After turning east again, MD 193 intersects Paint Branch Drive, which serves the Xfinity Center arena. The state highway passes Paint Branch Golf Course and crosses Paint Branch, after which the highway intersects US 1 at a partial interchange. The missing movements are made via a right-in\/right-out interchange on the eastbound side just to the east of the partial interchange, and through Greenbelt Road (unsigned MD 430) just to the east of Rhode Island Avenue, which has a westbound at-grade exit and eastbound entrance.",

Taylor Stadium\n\nHistory.\n\nThe softball team at the University of Maryland had been playing at an off campus softball complex ever since the programs inception in 1995. A new on-campus stadium and complex was in high demand to reward the young softball program which had risen to 12th in the national softball rankings in just its third season. Ground was broken in August 2001 to begin construction on the softball stadium. The construction coincided with the construction of the Comcast Center (now the Xfinity Center), the new arena for the men and women's basketball programs, which had begun construction a year earlier and was being built right next to the softball complex.\n\nRobert E. Taylor Stadium\n\nRobert E. Taylor Stadium opened April 10, 2002. The inaugural game pitted the Terrapins against in-state rival Towson. The first game in the stadium saw a no-hitter thrown by Maryland's Amanda Becker who struck out 7 Towson Tigers en route to her first no-hitter and a Maryland win.",

Deep Image poetry was inspired by the symbolist theory of correspondences, in particular the work of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca. The term later was popularized by Robert Bly. The Deep Image movement was the most international, accompanied by a flood of new translations from Latin American and European poets such as Pablo Neruda, César Vallejo and Tomas Tranströmer. Some of the poets who became associated with Deep Image are Galway Kinnell, James Wright, Mark Strand and W.S. Merwin. Both Merwin and California poet Gary Snyder became known for their interest in environmental and ecological concerns.\n\nAmerican poetry\n\nThe Small Press poets (sometimes called the mimeograph movement) are another influential and eclectic group of poets who surfaced in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1950s and are still active today. Fiercely independent editors, who were also poets, edited and published low-budget periodicals and chapbooks of emerging poets who might otherwise have gone unnoticed. This work ranged from formal to experimental. Gene Fowler, A.D. Winans, Hugh Fox, street poet and activist Jack Hirschman, Paul Foreman, Jim Cohn, John Bennett, and F.A.

         "context": "Land reforms by country\n\nIreland.\n\nAt the 19th century, most of the land in Ireland belonged to large landowners, most of them of English origin. Most of the Irish population were tenants, having few rights and forced to pay high rents. This situation was a contributory factor to the Great Irish Famine of 1845-1852 and the main cause of the Land Wars of 1870s-1890s.\n\nLand reforms by country\n\nThe governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland responded to the agitations in Ireland with a series of land acts, beginning with the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870 (initiated by prime minister William Ewart Gladstone), followed by further five land acts overseen by a Land Commission, prior to independence in 1922, by which time over 90% of lands had transferred from landlords to their former tenant farmers on negotiated terms with funding provided by the UK government.\n\nItaly.\n\nLand reform has been a long-standing and widespread problem before the 20th century, especially in Southern Italy. Despite the vain attempts of the governments to redistribute the land in Southern Italy (the so-called \"Mezzogiorno\"), from the pragmatic decree \"De administratione Universitatum \" (1792) of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies to the law \"Leggi eversive delle feudalità\" (which literally means \"laws abolishing feudalism\") in 1806–1808, enacted by Joseph Bonaparte, the issue remained largely unsolved, mainly because of the strenuous opposition of the great landowners, unwilling to lose their privileges and to allow the emancipation of the peasant class. Even with the Unification of Italy, despite the promises of the abolition of the so-called \"latifondi\" (\"large estates\"), the problem remained unsolved. Southern Italy's big landowners, which had been loyal to the Bourbons until the 1860, actively contributed to the unification of Italy in order to not lose its prestige, and expropriating estates from them would have implied, for the Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946), to have a powerful enemy. Southern Italy's peasants, disappointed and irritated, rebelled and provoked a bloody civil war, known as Post-Unification Brigandage.",

It had previously run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south had to leave the main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching the southern end of the walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord.

The Peddars Way, from Knettishall Heath to Holme-next-the-Sea, forms part of the \"Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail\", which was opened as a Long Distance Route in 1986. Between the Ridgeway and Peddars Way, parts of the original line of the Icknield Way had been covered in tarmac or built over, so a route was devised that avoids walking on roads. In 1992, this was designated by the Countryside Commission as a Regional Route called the \"Icknield Way Path\". The \"Wessex Ridgeway\" from Lyme Regis to Marlborough was declared open by Dorset County Council in 1994.",

The first such conference took place at Lambeth in 1867.\n\nLambeth Conference\n\nAs the Anglican Communion is an international association of autonomous national and regional churches and is not a governing body, the Lambeth Conferences serve a collaborative and consultative function, expressing \"the mind of the communion\" on issues of the day.\n\nResolutions which a Lambeth Conference may pass are without legal effect, but they are nonetheless influential. So, although the resolutions of conferences carry no legislative authority, they \"do carry great moral and spiritual authority.\" \"Its statements on social issues have influenced church policy in the churches.\"\n\nLambeth Conference\n\nThese conferences form one of the communion's four \"Instruments of Communion\".\n\nOrigins.\n\nThe idea of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury by Bishop John Henry Hopkins of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont in 1851. The possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the Church Missionary Society in 1851 when a number of US bishops were present in London. However, the initial impetus came from episcopal churches in Canada. In 1865 the synod of that province, in an urgent letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, (Charles Thomas Longley), represented the unsettlement of members of the Canadian church caused by recent legal decisions of the Privy Council and their alarm lest the revived action of convocation \"should leave us governed by canons different from those in force in England and Ireland, and thus cause us to drift into the status of an independent branch of the Catholic Church\". They therefore requested him to call a \"national synod of the bishops of the Anglican Church at home and abroad\", to meet under his leadership. After consulting both houses of the Convocation of Canterbury, Archbishop Longley assented and convened all the bishops of the Anglican Communion (then 144 in number) to meet at Lambeth in 1867.",

(See Anglican realignment)\n\nAnglican Communion\n\nThose who objected condemned these actions as unscriptural, unilateral, and without the agreement of the communion prior to these steps being taken.

The Ottomans turned Ardahan into a formidable fortress-town. In the 1640s the Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Ardahan and gave the following description: \"The fortress of Ardahan sits atop an inaccessible cliff. It is square-shaped and sturdy...

John Kilmaine of Alcester, England provides the following information on the structure: \"It is said that the pyramid is constructed on the old tumulus. The building of the pyramid is attributed to Sir John Browne the 7th Baronet and 1st Baron of Kilmaine, in memory of his brother, Sir George Browne. The structure, which at one time was crowned by a lead figure of Apollo, was designed by the Earl of Charlemont for his brother in law, Sir John Browne, The Neale\". There are a few varying stories of the building of the Pyramid. One such story is that Lord Kilmaine was anxious to find a way of relieving the extreme poverty of his tenants in the post famine years, so he employed several men to pick up the stones around the estate. He had those stones piled up and built into a pyramid. This provided the poor people with a little additional income. In the later years a wind-vane adorned the top of the pyramid, so the landlord could indulge in his passion for meteorology and the recording of weather systems over a period of 30 years. The Office of Public Works refurbished the Pyramid in 1990.",

He constructed a dam on Rancocas Creek to channel water through a raceway to power a gristmill and sawmill. Edward Gaskill and his sons dug the mill race on their property between 1720 and 1723. After the mills were established, more settlers were attracted to the area and built houses and commercial buildings on High, Church, White, Mill, and Pine streets, including the Shinn Curtis Log House (1712). By 1800, over 250 dwellings had been built.\n\nMount Holly, New Jersey\n\nToday no mills remain on the raceway, which still flows in its original course from the Rancocas just above the dam. The raceway proved a way for herring to make their way above the dam and was the scene of an annual fish run in the spring, which provided fresh herring for salting and eating. The former mill land has been preserved as the Mill Dam Park. It marks the importance of mills to the early settlements.",

The most common and accessible material to the rural population in Edo and Meiji Japan, was cotton. Due to industrialisation of the textile industry in the Meiji period (1868–1912), Monpe can also been made from other textiles, such as wool and hemp, which are thicker and more protective during the winter. A specific type of cotton is generally used, Kasuri cotton, to create distinctive patterns in the fabric when dyed. This technique is often aligned with the Indonesian dyeing method, ikat.

In premodern Japan, strict sumptuary laws were enacted by the Shogunate, which forbade farmers from wearing certain textiles such as silk, and colours such as purple, crimson, and plum-coloured dyes. However, one of the colours allowed was dark blue. Subsequently, rural workers began to be associated with blue clothing. While it does differ depending on region, traditionally the blue dye is contrasted with regular white geometric designs. Stripes are also used, although this pattern is considered one of the most complicated to weave. Also, there is slight variation between the stripes men and women would wear; men's stripes were woven in very narrow stripes, whereas women's stripes were wider and not so regular in spacing. Since the Taisho period (1912-1926) monpe have been made using more adventurous and brighter colour palettes, such as orange and purple, although even today indigo blue continues to be the most common.",

The Meiji period was defined by its drive towards both Westernisation and industrialisation, kickstarted by Japan opening its borders to the world in the 1860s, and this saw the rapid import of Western culture, clothing and technologies, including the introduction of synthetic dyestuffs to Japan; the first synthetic dye, mauveine, had been invented in the previous decade.\n\nKhalili Collection of Kimono\n\nJapan's newly-opened border also saw the export of Japanese culture to the West, where the kimono became an object of fascination.9 The Japanese textile industry rapidly Westernised in the face of foreign weaving technologies, and silk from Tokyo's factories became the principle export of Japan.117\n\nWith the introduction of cheaper and faster manufacture, more people could now afford silk kimono, and designers were able to create new patterns using the new methods of production.118 However, Emperor Meiji issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress,112 leading to the introduction of Western-style clothing within the public sphere, with some men typically adopting Western dress in the workplace (despite both women and men continuing to wear the kimono within the home) and most women continuing to wear the kimono in everyday life. Despite the introduction of Western dress, the kimono did not quickly fossilise as an object of tradition worn out of obligation by women and those unable to afford Western clothing; advertisements within Japan up until the 1940s display both the kimono and Western dress as items of fashionable wear, suggesting a more parallel evolution of the two within the Japanese wardrobe as equal, if differing, items of clothing.",

She was also strongly associated with Cosatu's anti-privatisation campaign, with Minister of Public Enterprises Jeff Radebe reportedly identifying her as a key ideologue (though Radebe denied this). Some observers linked criticism of Makgetla to broader tensions about the putatively outsized influence of non-Africans and leftists in the Tripartite Alliance; the South African Democratic Teachers' Union, for example, said that the personalised focus on Makgetla was \"racist\".",

In general, during the first round, ESPN or ESPN2 aired Cup playoff games Mondays through Thursdays, and TNT or TBS broadcast games Fridays through Sundays.

ESPN aired on Monday through Wednesday and the second weekend (including all Game 1's, 4's and 6's); TNT on Thursday, Friday, and the first Saturday (including all Game 2's and 5's); and TBS on the first Sunday. Game 2 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was originally scheduled for Friday, May 5. However, due to the NBA's Miami Heat's home game against the New York Knicks along with the 2023 Miami Grand Prix, Game 3 of Florida–Toronto was moved from Saturday, May 6 to Sunday, May 7, leaving the traditional \"Hockey Night in Canada\" timeslot available. Thus, Game 2 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was moved to Saturday, May 6, while a tripleheader of the other three series was held on Sunday, May 7. This left several Edmonton fans to suffer cancelation\/rescheduling fees for flights and tickets as they were not initially aware of the NHL schedule change. As a result, Game 6 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was moved to Sunday, May 14; despite this being the lone game on that day, its start time was pushed to 10:00 p.m. ET so ESPN could air it after \"Sunday Night Baseball\".",

It is also common for women to wear a single bangle or several bangles on just one wrist. Most Indian women prefer wearing either gold or glass bangles or a combination of both. Inexpensive bangles made from plastic are slowly replacing those made by glass, but the ones made of glass are still preferred at traditional occasions such as marriages and on festivals. Bangles are the signs for traditional women and girls. Bangles play a very important role in various Indian dance forms. Some of dance forms include bangles striking each other to produce a tone.\n\nBangle\n\nThe designs range from simple to intricate handmade designs, often studded with precious and semi-precious stones such as diamonds, gems and pearls. Sets of expensive bangles made of gold and silver make a jingling sound. The imitation jewellery tends to make a tinny sound when jingled.\n\nBangle\n\nTypes.\n\nThere are two basic types of bangles: a solid cylinder type; and a split, cylindrical spring opening\/closing type. The primary distinguishing factor between these is the material used to make the bangles. This may vary from anything from glass to jade to metal to lac and even rubber or plastic.",

It is today held in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery on the Roman Corso. (The gallery also houses his \"Penitent Magdalene\" and \"Rest on the Flight into Egypt\"). The collectors ordering the copies would have been aware of a further level of irony: the pose adopted by the model is a clear imitation of that adopted by one of Michelangelo's famous \"ignudi\" on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (painted 1508-1512). The role of these gigantic male nudes in Michelango's depiction of the world before the Laws of Moses has always been unclear – some have supposed them to be angels, others that they represent the Neo-Platonic ideal of human beauty – but for Caravaggio to pose his adolescent assistant as one of the Master's dignified witnesses to the Creation was clearly a kind of in-joke for the cognoscenti.\n\nJohn the Baptist (Caravaggio)\n\nIn 1601\/02 Caravaggio was apparently living and painting in the palazzo of the Mattei family, inundated with commissions from wealthy private clients following the success of the Contarelli chapel where in 1600 he had displayed \"The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew\" and \"The Inspiration of Saint Matthew\". It was one of the most productive periods in a productive career. Ciriaco Mattei's notebook records two payments to Caravaggio in July and December of that year, marking the beginning and completion of the original \"John the Baptist\". The payment was a relatively modest 85 scudi, because John was a single figure. The copy may have been made at the same time or very soon after. In January of that year Caravaggio received a hundred and fifty scudi for \"Supper at Emmaus\". For Vincenzo Giustiniani there was \"The Incredulity of Saint Thomas\", and in January 1603 Ciriaco paid a hundred and twenty-five scudi for \"The Taking of Christ\". Each of these increased the immense popularity of Caravaggio among collectors – twenty copies survive of the \"Supper at Emmaus\", more of the \"Taking of Christ\".",

Dürer produced a painted version of the subject, now in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid. This is the only painting of Dürer's that was directly influenced by Leonardo, however, Dürer introduced new subjects developed by Leonardo in his art (e.g. the figure of the young Saint John the Baptist in his composition of \"Madonna with the Siskin\" in 1506, which was not familiar to Venetian art at the time). Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520.

His \"Madonna and Child with the Lamb\", inspired by Leonardo's \"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\", and \"A Grotesque Old Woman\" (or \"The Ugly Duchess\"), show the influence of Leonardo. This is regarded as evidence that Matsys was greatly influenced by Italian Renaissance artists and that he most likely travelled to Italy, at least for a brief period.\n\nLeonardeschi\n\nIn 1516 or 1517, Leonardo joined the court of Francis I of France. Coincidentally, a Flemish portrait painter, Joos van Cleve, also was summoned to the French court, where he painted the king, queen, and other courtiers. It is thought that Joos van Cleve had spent some time in Italy as well as France on this trip. Like Quentin Massys, a fellow artist of Antwerp, Joos van Cleve appropriated some themes and techniques of Leonardo da Vinci. Often, Joos van Cleve is called the \"Leonardo of the North\". Paintings by the Italian Renaissance artists Giampietrino (\"Madonna of the Cherries\") and Marco d'Oggiono (\"The Holy Infants Embracing\"), both assistants in the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci, were a major influence on the Antwerp master. Joos van Cleve produced numerous versions of his own paintings after these models, adapting them to his own style and so creating some of the most successful compositions of the time in northern Europe. His son, Cornelis van Cleve, continued an artistic interest in Leonardo, producing several copies of his father's work and the \"Madonna of the Yarnwinder\".",

It is compositionally related to the artist's \"Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist\".\n\nBolognini Madonna\n\nDescription and style.\n\nIn the painting, a room with a pilaster decorated by candelabras in low relief opens onto a distant river landscape, far behind the portrait subject. Seated and at half figure, the Madonna holds the Baby Jesus in her lap as he plays with a young Saint John the Baptist who is handing him a cross—symbol of the future sacrifice of Jesus. The painting represents one of many variants on the theme of the meeting of Saint John and the Baby Jesus, a theme dear to Leonardo da Vince and to his Milanese Leonardeschi circle. The painting, in fact, is an example of the Leonardic influence on the young Correggio, both in the physical depiction of the Madonna, and in the landscape and the use of sfumato. The sfumato smudging is accentuated by the effects of shadows as in the veil of Marie that, hanging from the side of her head, casts a melancholy shadow over her face.",

The Board also had to contend with a more aggressive union movement, and a council that was seeking legislative authority to enable it to assume control of the tramway. This was to be one of many occasions on which it was suggested, or an attempt was made, to have the Board assimilated by the City Council or controlled by a Council-affiliated Metropolitan Board of Works.",

The Chinese on their part feared possible Portuguese retaliation, and in 1524 constructed a new fleet of war junks in preparation for future Portuguese incursions. However, the attacks were not forthcoming, and the fleet was left to decay. The new fleet's ships were either scuttled or captured by pirates. By 1528 no new ships were being constructed.\n\nBattle of Sincouwaan\n\nDespite hostilities, the Portuguese continued to trade and raid along the Fujian coastline for the next thirty years with the aid of corrupt local merchants with official connections. They formed a group of smugglers and pirates composed of Fujianese, Japanese, and Portuguese mariners. However this came to a stop with the appointment of Zhu Wan in 1547 as special grand coordinator to stamp out piracy in Zhejiang and Fujian. In 1548 Zhu Wan carried out a raid on Shuangyu, a pirate base off the coast of Zhejiang. In 1549 the Portuguese abandoned their goods after realizing the new administration had made it impossible for them to conduct business, and moved further south to Guangdong. Zhu Wan's success was short-lived, and he was convicted of wrongful executions by his enemies the same year. He eventually committed suicide.",

The Portuguese explorer Simão de Andrade incited poor relations with China due to his pirate activities, raiding Chinese shipping, attacking a Chinese official, and kidnappings of Chinese. He based himself at Tamao island in a fort. The Chinese claimed that Simão kidnapped Chinese boys and girls to be molested and cannibalized. The Chinese sent a squadron of junks against Portuguese caravels that succeeded in driving the Portuguese away and reclaiming Tamao. As a result, the Chinese posted an edict banning men with Caucasian features from entering Canton, killing multiple Portuguese there, and driving the Portuguese back to sea.\n\nPortuguese Empire\n\nAfter the Sultan of Bintan detained several Portuguese under Tomás Pires, the Chinese then executed 23 Portuguese and threw the rest into prison where they resided in squalid, sometimes fatal conditions. The Chinese then massacred Portuguese who resided at Ningbo and Fujian trading posts in 1545 and 1549, due to extensive and damaging raids by the Portuguese along the coast, which irritated the Chinese. Portuguese pirating was second to Japanese pirating by this period. However, they soon began to shield Chinese junks and a cautious trade began. In 1557 the Chinese authorities allowed the Portuguese to settle in Macau, creating a warehouse in the trade of goods between China, Japan, Goa and Europe.",

If the Commission de toponymie du Québec had approved the change, Park Avenue and Bleury Street in their entirety would have been renamed Robert Bourassa Avenue.

Saget was assisted in hosting the special by actress Kellie Martin, then the star of fellow ABC series \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" (as the voice of Daphne Blake) and family drama \"Life Goes On\" (as Becca Thatcher), which would serve as the lead-in program to \"AFHV\" for the latter show's first four seasons. Prior to the airing of the initial special, during the fall of 1989, Vin Di Bona Productions took out ads in national magazines (such as \"TV Guide\") asking people to send in their home videos featuring funny or amazing moments.\n\nAmerica's Funniest Home Videos\n\nJohn Ritter was Vin Di Bona's first choice as host of the program, but was unavailable. Los Angeles sports reporter Fred Roggin of KNBC was also approached, as well, but due to his contract negotiations with NBC, he was unable to, though Roggin would eventually host a similar show of his own called \"Roggin's Heroes\" airing in syndication from 1991–1993. Originally intended as a one-off special, it became an unexpected hit, causing ABC to place an episode order for the show turning it into a regular weekly half-hour primetime series; it made its debut as a regular series on January 14, 1990, with Saget hosting solo. Ernie Anderson, the longtime voice of ABC, was the program's original announcer. He was replaced by radio and television actor Gary Owens in 1995, who stayed in that role until Saget left, but Anderson briefly returned via archived recordings, the final episode he appeared in airing in March 1997. Charlie O'Donnell occasionally substituted for Anderson during some season one episodes. Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of \"AFHV\" led to a spinoff called \"America's Funniest People,\" hosted by Saget's \"Full House\" co-star Dave Coulier (and co-hosted by actress\/producer Arleen Sorkin for the first two seasons, then model Tawny Kitaen for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people \"intentionally\" trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.",

Stalin, in Ukraine at the time, argued these ambitions were unrealistic but lost.

In mid-August, the Commander-in-Chief Sergei Kamenev ordered the transfer of troops (1st Cavalry Army, commanded by Semyon Budyonny and Kliment Voroshilov) from Yegorov's forces to reinforce the attack on Warsaw led by Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Stalin refused to counter-sign the order because it did not have the requisite two signatures on it, a reasonable response.

Kennan wrote in his diary: \"Bullitt is a striking man, confident in himself, confident of the president's support, confident that he will have no difficulty in cracking the nut of Communist suspicion and hostility...He is not a radical, but he is not afraid of radicals\". Upon his arrival in Moscow via train on 11 December, he was greeted by Litvinov at the station.

On 20 December 1933, Bullitt first met Joseph Stalin, the first secretary of the Communist Party, at a dinner party at the Kremlin that was also attended by the premier Vyacheslav Molotov; the Defense Commissar, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov; Litvinov; Stalin's chief of staff, Alexander Yegorov; and the commissar for heavy industry, Grigori Piatokov. Stalin was a rather mysterious figure whom foreigners were rarely allowed to see and Bullitt noted that it was an \"extraordinary gesture\" that he was allowed to see Stalin in the Kremlin. Bullitt reported to Roosevelt that Stalin was \"rather short\", but that he had powerful brown eyes that were \"intensely shrewd and continuously smiling\". When Bullitt asked about reports of a famine that had killed millions in the Soviet countryside, he received a blanket denial from Stalin.",

The team first played as the Cleveland Nets in 1974, and was known as the Cleveland–Pittsburgh Nets in 1977, when it played roughly half of its home matches in each city. The Nets moved to New Orleans for the 1978 season. Following the 1978 season, the Nets announced that the team would fold. The Nets played all five seasons in WTT from the league's inception in 1974, until its suspension of operations after the 1978 season. The team had losing records in each of its five seasons.\n\nNew Orleans Sun Belt Nets\n\nTeam history.\n\nInaugural season.\n\nThe Nets were founded as WTT's charter franchise for Cincinnati, Ohio in 1973, by Bill DeWitt, Jr. and Brian Heekin. Within weeks of being established, and before the team ever had a name in Cincinnati, DeWitt and Heekin sold it to Cleveland radio executive Joseph Zingale who paid them the same $50,000 as the franchise fee they had paid to WTT. Zingale relocated the team to Cleveland with a plan to have it play its home matches at the Cleveland Public Hall starting with the league's inaugural 1974 season and name it the Cleveland Nets. Before the draft, Zingale spoke to Clark Graebner, a native of Cleveland, about playing for the team as well as to being its coach and general manager. Graebner insisted his wife, Carole, had to be drafted by the team as well. The Nets selected them both as a pair in the fourth round of the draft. No other WTT team objected to the Nets selecting two players with one draft choice. When Clark and Carole Graebner separated, Clark traded Carole to the Pittsburgh Triangles. The couple never divorced, and Carole Graebner died in 2008. Peaches Bartkowicz was a key women's doubles player for the 1974 Nets but quit the team during the season. Through all the drama, the Nets finished with 21 wins and 23 losses, third in the Atlantic Section and snuck into the playoffs.",

To Caesar, Munda was supposed to be a mop-up action after Pompey's main forces were defeated in Greece. But Munda was no mop-up exercise. Tens of thousands of Romans were killed on both sides; there was no decisive victory for Caesar's armies; and one of Pompey's sons, Sextus, fled to fight another day as a famous rebel pirate against Caesar's successor, Augustus.\n\nAcinipo\n\nSome Spanish historians state that Munda is the Roman name for Ronda, where the battle of Munda may have been fought. According to Pliny, the battle of Munda was fought in Osuna, about 50 km north of Ronda in the province of Seville. But there is general agreement that Acinipo was created for retired veterans of Caesar's legions, while Arunda (Ronda) would be a separate Roman outpost, perhaps created before the Munda conflict for the veterans of Pompey's legions.",

With the military victory at Munda and the deaths of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompeius (eldest son of Pompey), Caesar was politically able to return in triumph to Rome, and then govern as the elected Roman dictator. Subsequently, the assassination of Julius Caesar began the Republican decline that led to the Roman Empire, initiated with the reign of the emperor Augustus.\n\nBattle of Munda\n\nPrelude.\n\nThe republicans had initially been led by Pompey, until the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC and Pompey's death soon afterwards. However, in April 46 BC, Caesar's forces destroyed the Pompeian army at the Battle of Thapsus.\n\nBattle of Munda\n\nAfter this, military opposition to Caesar was confined to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal). During the Spring of 46 BC, two legions in Hispania Ulterior, largely formed by former Pompeian veterans enrolled in Caesar's army, had declared themselves for Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great) and driven out Caesar's proconsul. Soon they were joined by the remnants of the Pompeian army. These forces were commanded by the brothers Gnaeus and Sextus Pompeius (sons of Pompey), Publius Attius Varus and by the talented general Titus Labienus, who had been one of the most trusted of Caesar's generals during the Gallic Wars. Using the resources of the province, they were able to raise an army of four legions. These were the two original veteran legions, a legion formed from the survivors of Thapsus, and an additional legion recruited from Roman citizens and local inhabitants. They took control of almost all Hispania Ulterior, including the important Roman colonies of Italica and Corduba (the capital of the province). Caesar's generals Quintus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Pedius did not risk a battle, and remained encamped at Obulco (present-day Porcuna), about east of Corduba, requesting help from Caesar.",

The book largely concerned the influence of the China lobby in the US congress and the executive branch of the government. It also discussed the heroin trafficking by the Chinese Nationalist Party – then the ruling party of the military dictatorship in Taiwan. Koen detailed considerable evidence of this, and it was later corroborated by other scholars. The Chinese Nationalist Party instigated the suppression through their embassy in Washington, after they had initially threatened a libel suit against the publisher, MacMillan. After 4000 copies of the book had been printed, at the intervention of the State Department the publisher recalled the book and discontinued publication. Some copies of the book nevertheless found their way into rare book repositories at some universities. According to Richard C. Kagan, right-wing groups stole many remaining copies of the book from libraries. The book was reprinted in 1974 after other scholars had shown Koen's findings to be accurate.",

In Handsworth near Sheffield, he began producing steel in 1740 after years of experimenting in secret. Huntsman's system used a coke-fired furnace capable of reaching 1,600 °C, into which up to twelve clay crucibles, each capable of holding about 15 kg of iron, were placed. When the crucibles or \"pots\" were white-hot, they were charged with lumps of blister steel, an alloy of iron and carbon produced by the cementation process, and a flux to help remove impurities. The pots were removed after about 3 hours in the furnace, impurities in the form of slag skimmed off, and the molten steel poured into moulds to end up as cast ingots. Complete melting of the steel produced a highly uniform crystal structure upon cooling, which gave the metal increased tensile strength and hardness in comparison with other steels being made at the time.\n\nCrucible steel\n\nBefore the introduction of Huntsman's technique, Sheffield produced about 200 tonnes of steel per year from Swedish wrought iron (see Oregrounds iron). The introduction of Huntsman's technique changed this radically: one hundred years later the amount had risen to over 80,000 tonnes per year, or almost half of Europe's total production. Sheffield developed from a small township into one of Europe's leading industrial cities.",

The earliest official record of cutlery production, for which Sheffield is particularly well known, is from 1297 when a tax return for 'Robert the Cutler' was submitted. A key reason for Sheffield's success in the production of cutlery lies in its geographic makeup. The abundance of streams in the area provided water power and the geological formations in the Hope Valley, in particular, provided sufficient grit stones for grinding wheels. In the 17th century, the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, which oversaw the booming cutlery industry in the area and remains to this day, was established and focused on markets outside the Sheffield area, leading to the gradual establishment of Sheffield as a respected producer of cutlery. this gradually developed from a national reputation into an international one.\n\nSheffield\n\nPlaying a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, the city became an industrial powerhouse in the 18th century, and was dubbed \"Steel City\".

Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer &amp; Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton.

Huntsman's process used iron and steel as raw materials, in the form of blister steel, rather than direct conversion from cast iron as in puddling or the later Bessemer process. The ability to fully melt the steel removed any inhomogeneities in the steel, allowing the carbon to dissolve evenly into the liquid steel and negating the prior need for extensive blacksmithing in an attempt to achieve the same result. Similarly, it allowed steel to be cast by pouring into molds. The use of fluxes allowed nearly complete extraction of impurities from the liquid, which could then simply float to the top for removal. This produced the first steel of modern quality, providing a means of efficiently changing excess wrought iron into useful steel. Huntsman's process greatly increased the European output of quality steel suitable for use in items like knives, tools, and machinery, helping to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution.",

Huntsman played first-class cricket on seven occasions between 1846–52, making six appearances for Sheffield (aka Yorkshire). Five of these came against Manchester (aka Lancashire), with one against Nottingham (aka Nottinghamshire). He made one first-class appearance for a team playing as Yorkshire against Lancashire at Sheffield in 1851. He scored 47 runs in his seven matches, with a high score of 16.\n\nBenjamin Huntsman (cricketer)\n\nOutside of cricket, Huntsman was a proprietor of land and houses, in addition to owning the Tinsley Park Collieries. During the Strike of 1869–70, he locked out his miners and employed non-union staff. He was a member of the 1st West Yorkshire Yeomanry, having been appointed as a cornet in May 1852. He gained the rank of lieutenant in April 1856, before being promoted to captain in March 1862. He resigned his commission in February 1872. He was also an alderman of the city of Nottingham and was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in May 1887. Huntsman died in June 1893 at West Retford, Nottinghamshire. His great-grandfather was Benjamin Huntsman, the inventor and manufacturer of cast or crucible steel.",

During the 17th century, it was realized that the best steel came from oregrounds iron of a region north of Stockholm, Sweden. This was still the usual raw material source in the 19th century, almost as long as the process was used.\n\nSteel\n\nCrucible steel is steel that has been melted in a crucible rather than having been forged, with the result that it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.\n\nSteel\n\nProcesses starting from pig iron.\n\nThe modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry Bessemer's process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or \"basic Bessemer process\") was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.",

At least 27 movies have portrayed fictional accounts of the first drive along the Chisholm Trail, including \"The Texans\" (1938), directed by James P. Hogan and starring Randolph Scott and Joan Bennett; and \"Red River\" (1948), directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. Walter Brennan co-starred in both films.\n\nChisholm Trail\n\nThe trail is the subject of at least two pop songs: \"The Last Cowboy Song,\" written and recorded by Ed Bruce, also performed by The Highwaymen; and the song \"The Old Chisholm Trail.\" Among those who have covered the song are Gene Autry, Girls of the Golden West, Woody Guthrie, Michael Martin Murphey, Tex Ritter, and Roy Rogers. Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter) also covered this song, although his version was titled \"When I Was A Cowboy\".

The original turbines were replaced by two new ones, supplied by Voith Group, which incorporate automatic adjustment of the guide vanes by an autonomous hydraulic control unit.

A diesel generator supplied power to parts of Portree, while the village of Broadford was supplied from the power station at Nostie Bridge on the Scottish mainland by a cable that run for under the sea. A switching-on ceremony was held at Kyleakin on 6 May 1947, to inaugurate the undersea supply from Nostie to Broadford, at which Lady Mackenzie presided. The cable was sized to supply 85 per cent of the population of Skye, but once the formal opening ceremony had been completed, Edward MacColl, the chief executive of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, was able to anounce that the Storr Lochs scheme had just been approved by the Electricity Commissioners.\n\nStorr Lochs Hydro-Electric Scheme\n\nThe Board received permission to proceed with the construction of the project in late 1949, and work began in early 1950. Water was supplied by Loch Fada and Loch Leathan, which are situated between the main road from Portree to Staffin and the sea. The turbine house was located on the shore at Bearreraig Bay, separated from the lochs by a cliff. In order to overcome the difficulties of accessing this site, a funicular railway was built at the start of the project, and used to transport men and materials down to the shore. The formation for the railway included 647 steps cast into the concrete. The railway is standard gauge with a maximum gradient of 1 in 2, and an electric winch controls the movement of the single carriage. Prior to its construction, the Board anticipated that materials could be brought to the beach by landing craft, but the loss of one vessel and all the equipment it was carrying due to the fierce tides resulted in this approach being abandoned.",

A long wing wall was built across the surrounding hillside, to provide additional stability to the dam, because of the boggy nature of the terrain.

The consulting engineers were Blyth and Blyth of Edinburgh, while construction was carried out by James Miller and Partners, also from Edinburgh. The official opening took place on 31 May 1952, when Lady Rachel Stuart, wife of the Secretary of State for Scotland, James Stuart, started the turbines. Tom Johnston was by this time chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, and used the occasion to say that despite those who felt that electricity was unnecessary, because the Highlanders were satisfied with their oil lamps, 850 houses were already connected to the grid, and this total would rise to 2500 during 1953..

The stars would own the studio and the program, as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had done successfully with Desilu studio. Powell had intended for the program to feature himself, Charles Boyer, Joel McCrea, and Rosalind Russell. When Russell and McCrea backed out, David Niven came on board as the third star. The fourth star was initially a guest star. CBS liked the idea, and \"Four Star Playhouse\" made its debut in fall of 1952. It ran on alternate weeks only during the first season, alternating with \"Amos 'n' Andy\". It was successful enough to be renewed and became a weekly program from the second season until the end of its run in 1956. Ida Lupino was brought on board as the de facto fourth star, though unlike Powell, Boyer, and Niven, she owned no stock in the company.",

The son of former West Perth and Subiaco player Don Marinko, Sr., Marinko excelled at junior football, and began his career at West Perth in 1954, at the age of 18.

An excellent junior footballer, Marinko played under-18 football for the West Perth Cobbers in the Young Sports Temperance League at the age of 18, and also captained the under-15 side at the same time. In 1953, having begun playing for Mount Hawthorn in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (MJFA), he was selected in representative side to tour Victoria. The youngest member of the team, Marinko stayed with former Collingwood player Gordon Coventry while in Melbourne, thus avoiding the troubles of his teammates, who had their clothes stolen whilst staying at a YMCA. Joining his brother in the team, Marinko made his senior debut for West Perth against East Fremantle in round one of the 1954 season, having replaced the injured Brian Falconer. He played a total of 22 games in his first season, alternating between centre and the half-back and half-forward flanks. Marinko was known for his exceptional footpassing, with \"The West Australian\" noting that his main attribute was \"accurate kicking with either foot\". Having established himself as a regular in West Perth's senior side, he was also strong overhead, with a spectacular mark over East Fremantle's Ray French during the 1956 season said to be equal to John Gerovich's famous mark over the same player, although no documentary evidence of the mark has survived.",

It is located in the city centre, situated on a small island in River Pielisjoki. Built in 1852 originally as a Crown granary, the building was designed by a leading architect of public buildings of the time, Ernst Lohrmann, in the neoclassical style.\n\nPielisjoki Castle\n\nThe building has never served as a castle as such; after it ceased to operate as a granary, it was given over to the \"Suojeluskunta\" civil guard and converted in 1919 to office and residential use, according to the designs by the architect Ole Gripenberg. The ground floor housed staff quarters, arsenal and a drive-through carriageway for loading and offloading vehicles. The first floor comprised offices, with the commander's residence on the top floor.\n\nPielisjoki Castle\n\nAfter the \"Suojeluskunta\" organisation was dismantled, the building was occupied by the military. Following a renovation in the late 1960s, the building housed for over three decades various research units and activities of the University of Eastern Finland. Its current tenant is the North Karelian regional association \"Pohjois-Karjalan Maakuntaliitto\".",

The cathedral was built on the site of the smaller 1724–1727 Ulrika Eleonora Church (Helsinki), which had been dedicated to its patroness, Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden. Helsinki Old Church was built between 1824 and 1826 in nearby Kamppi to serve the parish while the Ulrika Eleonora Church was being demolished and until the consecration of the new cathedral. The bells of the old church were reused in the cathedral. Construction of the cathedral began in 1830, although it was only officially inaugurated on 15 February 1852. Engel died in 1840.\n\nHelsinki Cathedral\n\nThe building was later altered by Engel's successor Ernst Lohrmann, whose four small domes emphasise the architectural connection to the cathedral's models, Saint Isaac's Cathedral and Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Lohrmann also designed two extra buildings to the sides of the steps: looking from the square the left building is a bell tower and the right building a chapel. He also erected larger-than-life sized zinc statues of the Twelve Apostles at the apexes and corners of the roofline in 1849. They were sculpted by August Wredov and Hermann Schievelbein and cast by S. P. Devaranne in Berlin in 1845–1847. The altarpiece was painted by Carl Timoleon von Neff and donated to the church by Emperor Nicholas I. The cathedral crypt was renovated in the 1980s by architects Vilhelm Helander and Juha Leiviskä for use in exhibitions and church functions; Helander was also responsible for conservation repairs on the cathedral in the late 1990s.",

While the majority of teams in the United States come from the Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions, there are teams from other regions, most notably from Kentucky and New York. Free Methodist quizzing also takes place in Kenya, the Philippines and Taiwan. Teams and individuals compete at monthly conference, regional and multi-regional tournaments throughout the quiz season, culminating in a National Bible Quiz finals each year, hosted by a Free Methodist College\/University.\n\nBible quiz\n\nQuiz teams and individuals can compete in four divisions, depending on the experience level of competitors—Young Teen Rookie, Young Teen Veteran, Senior Teen Rookie, or Senior Teen Veteran. Teams and individuals that place receive a trophy and, in some divisions and competitions, scholarships. The winner of the Senior Teen Veteran National Bible Quiz Finals Team competition in Free Methodist Quizzing receives the Alpha-Omega trophy, which consists of a base on which the names of all previous winners are engraved. The back has three small stained glass windows, and there is also a platform for a detachable trophy that looks like a Bible. The winning team keeps the bible trophy and transports the base to the Quiz Team Finals the next year.",

They are a popular activity in some Protestant churches and organizations, particularly in the United States. The exact rules of the game differ depending on the sponsoring organization.\n\nBible quiz\n\nMost organizations have seasons which roughly correspond with the U.S. school year (September–early July), holding local competitions on a monthly basis, with playoffs that lead to a national championship tournament. Contestants are usually students in grades six through twelve, although some organizations also offer a separate division for younger children.\n\nBible quiz\n\nThe competition is similar to Quick Recall in many American schools, but it uses the Bible as the subject. Competitions which use the name \"Bible Bowl\" are modelled on television's \"College Bowl\" in the 1950s. All groups feature teams competing to be the first to \"buzz in\" using an electronic lockout device, much like those still used in TV game shows such as \"Jeopardy",

A regulation game consists of two 10-minute halves with 20 toss-up and 20 bonus questions; a shortened version of 14 minutes with 15 toss-ups and 15 bonuses is used for round robin competition. The time limit tends to create a faster environment and more closely reflects College Bowl in that it is more entertaining for non-participants to watch. Due to the fact that a regulation game contains 20 toss-ups and 20 bonuses (each of which has from 4 to 8 specific questions), a Bible Bowl game can have a total of 170 different questions asked in the 20 minutes allotted to the game, more than any other Bible Quiz game. Again, this difference requires the game to move rapidly, and also contributes to the audience-friendly nature of the contest, since there is almost constant interaction between the quizmaster and the players. Some of the question types also add to the audience friendliness of the game (\"Put these words together to get a brand of soap\", \"Clue-by-Clue until you know who\", etc.).",

On that day, Fort Bull was occupied by 25 soldiers of 50th (Shirley's) Regiment plus 34 carpenters, boatmen and carters together with three women. At about 11 am, the French and Indians began to approach Fort Bull silently when the Indians gave a war cry that alerted the British. Léry asked that the Iroquois refrain from their \"horrendous war cries\" that were meant to strike terror in the heart of the enemy in order to take the British by surprise, but at about 900 feet (275 m) away from Fort Bull, the Iroquois gave their customary war cries. Seeing the British were alerted, the French shouted \"Vive le roi\n\nBattle of Fort Bull\n\nThe attackers managed to fire through loopholes in the fort's walls to distract the garrison, which responded by throwing rocks and grenades over the walls. The French and the Indians fired through the loopholes, trapping much of the garrison within the buildings while the militiamen tried to chop their way in through the wooden walls with tomahawks and the \"troupes de la Marine\" used their axes to try to smash their way in through the main gate. The tomahawks proved ineffective at smashing through the gate, and Léry in his report mentioned smashing his way in with \"à coup de haches\" (\"by ax blows\"), suggesting that heavy axes were used. Speaking through an interpreter, Léry demanded that the fort surrender, but he reported that \"the fire of the enemy became livelier and more determined\". Léry wrote Bull's defense was conducted \"with all the possible bravery and intrepidity that I have always remarked of with English officers\". Collière, the Iroquois chief was killed by a British bullet going through his head fired by Colonel Bull. After Bull refused several calls to surrender, the gate was smashed down at about noon by using a fallen tree trunk as a battering ram, and the attackers stormed into the fort. Ignoring the ineffective British musket fire, the French charged forward and used their bayonets and tomahawks to cut down any British soldier in their path as they raced throughout the fort. One of the Iroquois warriors avenged Collière's death by using his tomahawk to smash in Bull's head. The wife of Bull was killed by an Iroquois warrior who smashed in her face with his tomahawk, scalped her, and accidentally caused a fire when he tossed her corpse into a fire, pulled her corpse out with a burning skirt that according to the French \"set fire to the house\".",

For example, both natural deduction and sequent calculus systems facilitate the elimination and introduction of universal and existential quantifiers so that unquantified logical expressions can be manipulated according to the much simpler rules of propositional calculus. In a typical argument, quantifiers are eliminated, then propositional calculus is applied to unquantified expressions (which typically contain free variables), and then the quantifiers are reintroduced. This very much parallels the way in which mathematical proofs are carried out in practice by mathematicians. Predicate calculus proofs are generally much easier to discover with this approach, and are often shorter. Natural deduction systems are more suited to practical theorem-proving. Sequent calculus systems are more suited to theoretical analysis.\n\nSequent calculus\n\nOverview.\n\nIn proof theory and mathematical logic, sequent calculus is a family of formal systems sharing a certain style of inference and certain formal properties. The first sequent calculi systems, LK and LJ, were introduced in 1934\/1935 by Gerhard Gentzen as a tool for studying natural deduction in first-order logic (in classical and intuitionistic versions, respectively). Gentzen's so-called \"Main Theorem\" (\"Hauptsatz\") about LK and LJ was the cut-elimination theorem, a result with far-reaching meta-theoretic consequences, including consistency. Gentzen further demonstrated the power and flexibility of this technique a few years later, applying a cut-elimination argument to give a (transfinite) proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic, in surprising response to Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Since this early work, sequent calculi, also called Gentzen systems, and the general concepts relating to them, have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic, and automated deduction.",

Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\".

In response to this, Stanisław Jaśkowski (1929) and Gerhard Gentzen (1934) independently provided such systems, called calculi of natural deduction, with Gentzen's approach introducing the idea of symmetry between the grounds for asserting propositions, expressed in introduction rules, and the consequences of accepting propositions in the elimination rules, an idea that has proved very important in proof theory. Gentzen (1934) further introduced the idea of the sequent calculus, a calculus advanced in a similar spirit that better expressed the duality of the logical connectives, and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic, and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic.

Their pioneering tribulations in establishing a sheep and cattle grazing station and homestead are graphically recounted by William Rhodes James (1817-1898) in his journal. ‘James Track’, a present day arterial road, dates from this time.

Following the death of their father in April 1840, Rhodes James returned to England in June 1841, selling out his share in the land orders to his two younger brothers. John Vidal James (1820-1897) also soon left the station, settling on his own farming estate at Willunga.

Step forward, Billie Eilish, the world’s most melancholic teenage pop star, who wraps her intimate, whispered vocals over words that, in proper Bond style, seem on the surface to be profound but in fact don’t mean much at all.\" Saeed Saeed of \"The National\" wrote, \"While the pulsating score by German composer Hans Zimmer fulfils the brief in heightening the film’s spectacular action sequences, the creation of the music featured a few dramas of its own... The solitary vocal tune in the soundtrack is the titular track performed by Billie Eilish. While the dramatic power ballad, with her trademark whispery vocals and sweeping strings, was acclaimed and won a Grammy Award in March, the recording process wasn’t so smooth.\"",

The results of a phase-III trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients, were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself.

In doing so, he committed a great injustice to his former commander's memory by magnifying his faults and frequently distorting the historical record. In the wake of the resumed fighting between France and Britain, Péron also drafted a secret \"Mémoire sur les établissements anglais à la Nouvelle Hollande\", which advocated a French conquest of Port Jackson with the aid of rebellious Irish convicts.\n\nFrançois Péron\n\nPéron died of tuberculosis in his hometown of Cérilly in 1810.

Very little is known about him, but the records of Baudin's voyage, together with annotations on surviving plant specimens collected by him, suggest that he was poorly educated, with atrocious spelling and little knowledge of botany, yet worked extremely hard, collecting more plant specimens than the officially appointed botanist, Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour, and, despite his poor literacy, labelling them with much more useful annotations.

The film, released shortly before Japan invaded Shanghai and initiated the Second Sino-Japanese War in summer 1937, became a massive hit with audiences.

Other major films of the period include \"Love and Duty\" (1931), \"Little Toys\" (1933), \"New Women\" (1934), \"Song of the Fishermen\" (1934), \"Plunder of Peach and Plum\" (1934), \"Crossroads\" (1937), and \"Street Angel\" (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the Nationalists and the Communists struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.\n\nCinema of China\n\nJapanese occupation and World War II.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of China in 1937, in particular the Battle of Shanghai, ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except Xinhua Film Company (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to Hong Kong, the wartime Nationalist capital Chongqing, and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"Solitary Island\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director Bu Wancang's \"Hua Mu Lan\", also known as \"Mulan Joins the Army\" (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war. This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on 7 December 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere-promoting \"Eternity\" (1943) were produced. At the end of World War II, one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized companies, Manchukuo Film Association, would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.",
