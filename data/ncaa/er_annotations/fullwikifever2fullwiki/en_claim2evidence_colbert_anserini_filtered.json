They were overcrowded, had limited sanitation, and were characterised by pollution, crime and congestion, becoming a dystopian symbol. As a result, there was a mass exodus from cities throughout the 19th century.\n\nSustainable urban neighbourhood\n\nThe 20th century British city was no longer home to a cross-section of society and urban populations became characterised by those unable to escape, whilst the leafy, low density suburb became the residential aspiration. The growth of the private car fed the expansion of the Anglo-American city into sprawling suburbia. As mobility increased, not only people but commercial activity fled to leave a deserted inner city surrounded by sprawling industrial estates, business parks, and suburban residential areas, termed ‘edge cities’.",

The name was first given in 1629 to the territory between the Merrimack and Piscataqua rivers on the eastern coast of North America, and was named after the county of Hampshire in southern England by Captain John Mason, its first named proprietor. In 1776 the province established an independent state and government, the State of New Hampshire, and joined with twelve other colonies to form the United States.\n\nProvince of New Hampshire\n\nEuropeans first settled New Hampshire in the 1620s, and the province consisted for many years of a small number of communities along the seacoast, Piscataqua River, and Great Bay. In 1641 the communities were organized under the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, until Charles II issued a colonial charter for the province and appointed John Cutt as President of New Hampshire in 1679. After a brief period as a separate province, the territory was absorbed into the Dominion of New England in 1686. Following the collapse of the unpopular Dominion, on October 7, 1691 New Hampshire was again separated from Massachusetts and organized as an English crown colony. Its charter was enacted on May 14, 1692, during the coregency of William and Mary, the joint monarchs of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Between 1699 and 1741, the province's governor was often concurrently the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. This practice ended completely in 1741, when Benning Wentworth was appointed governor. Wentworth laid claim on behalf of the province to lands west of the Connecticut River, east of the Hudson River, and north of Massachusetts, issuing controversial land grants that were disputed by the Province of New York, which also claimed the territory. These disputes resulted in the eventual formation of the Vermont Republic and the U.S. state of Vermont.",

Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the Sinai Peninsula, which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).\n\nConstantin von Tischendorf\n\nIn 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.\n\nTischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.",

Returning in 1859, this time under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, he was shown Codex Sinaiticus. He would later claim to have found it discarded in a rubbish bin. (This story may have been a fabrication, or the manuscripts in question may have been unrelated to Codex Sinaiticus: Rev. J. Silvester Davies in 1863 quoted \"a monk of Sinai who... stated that according to the librarian of the monastery the whole of Codex Sinaiticus had been in the library for many years and was marked in the ancient catalogues... Is it not likely... that a manuscript known in the library catalogue would have been jettisoned in the rubbish basket.\" Indeed, it has been noted that the leaves were in \"suspiciously good condition\" for something found in the trash.) Tischendorf had been sent to search for manuscripts by Russia's Tsar Alexander II, who was convinced there were still manuscripts to be found at the Sinai monastery.

The closest living relatives of gars are the bowfin, with the gars and bowfin together forming the clade Holostei; both lineages diverged during the Late Permian.",

The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, but as the roe's temperature does not typically reach that level when it is cooked, even cooked roe causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs, but bluegills and channel catfish fed gar eggs in experiments remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish fed the roe were not immune to the toxin, and most died. The roe's toxicities to humans and crayfish may be coincidences, however, and not the result of explicit natural selection.\n\nGar\n\nSignificance to humans.\n\nSeveral species are traded as aquarium fish. The hard ganoid scales of gars are sometimes used to make jewelry whereas the tough skin is used to make such items as lamp shades. Historically, Native Americans used gar scales as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows with gar skin. Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture other than the ritual \"garfish dances\" that have been performed by Creek and Chickasaw tribes.",

In some cases, a river flows into the ground or becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to by names such as creek, brook, and rivulet. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities, a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \"run\" in some parts of the United States, \"burn\" in Scotland and Northeast England, and \"beck\" in Northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always; the language is vague.\n\nRiver\n\nRivers are an important part of the water cycle. Water from a drainage basin generally collects into a river through surface runoff from precipitation, meltwater released from natural ice and snowpacks, and other underground sources such as groundwater recharge and springs. Rivers are often considered major features within a landscape; however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth. Rivers are also an important natural terraformer, as the erosive action of running water carves out rills, gullies, and valleys in the surface as well as transferring silt and dissolved minerals downstream, forming river deltas and islands where the flow slows down. As a waterbody, rivers also serve crucial ecological functions by providing and feeding freshwater habitats for aquatic and semiaquatic fauna and flora, especially for migratory fish species, as well as enabling terrestrial ecosystems to thrive in the riparian zones.",

A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation, which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains.

As a consequence, when the last Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus was deposed by military commander Odoacer in 476, his direct rule did not extend much beyond the current Northern borders of Italy. Another military leader, Julius Nepos, briefly Romulus Augustulus's predecessor, held territory in Dalmatia and kept the Imperial title until his assassination in 480.",

The Terrans left their physical bodies and locked their souls in Pandemonium to be watched over by Garland until the Fusion's completion. The Fusion was a disastrous failure, leaving Gaia's surface in ruin and ending up with Terra shifting inside the planet of Gaia. Garland was tasked with removing the souls of Gaia's \"cycle of souls\" and replacing them with Terra's.

In 2020 NHK conducted an All-\"Final Fantasy\" Grand Poll of Japanese players, featuring over 468,000 votes. The poll results revealed that Zidane was ranked the fifth greatest \"Final Fantasy\" character by Japanese respondents, just after Vivi who was ranked fourth. Game journalists listed him as one of the greatest \"Final Fantasy\" characters based on multiple of his traits.\n\nZidane Tribal\n\nSome reviewers praised the character's personality. \"IGN\" editor David Smith called him charming, and that he \"breaks the streak of reluctant \"Final Fantasy\" heroes, injecting a touch of redder blood back into the series\". For Zidane's appearance in \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\", \"IGN\" editor Ryan Clements described Zidane as a \"laid back, flirtatious character and one full of energy and enthusiasm\", unlike his peers from other numbered entries. He adds that seeing his \"short blades spin in a dizzying frenzy is definitely a sight to behold\". \"GameSpot\" editor Andrew Vestal called Zidane's \"instinctive womanizing\" as an amusing trait of his. Jeremy Parish from \"Polygon\" thought Zidane have \"a roguish, Han Solo-like quality to him, making him something of a small fry and an outsider in a big-picture narrative that involves kingdoms at war, almighty summoned monsters and ancient races\", until the manifestation of conventional \"Final Fantasy\" tropes which reveal Zidane's true cosmic origins. Lucas White from \"Playstation Lifestyle\" noted that \"his personality and motivations are drastically different from those of his peers, making him the driving force of \"Final Fantasy IX's\" unique flavor\", and that at his core is \"his ability to protect people he cares about; his essence is his virtue\". Daniella Lucas from \"Gamesradar\" thought Zidane was \"cool with his dual daggers\", and noted that \"Zidane's tale of adventure and self discovery while dealing with the evil that Kuja inflicts upon the world of Gaia is as classic as \"Final Fantasy\" gets\". Michel S. Beaulieu, co-author of the book \"Final Fantasy and Philosophy: The Ultimate Walkthrough\" suggested that Zidane is a revolutionary, fighting against the abusive power of the upper class, represented by Queen Brahne.",

Unsuccessful in his search, he returns to Baku and rejoins his troupe of performers and criminals called Tantalus.\n\nZidane Tribal\n\nAt the age of sixteen, he becomes involved in Baku's scheme to kidnap Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII, fomented by Regent Cid Fabool VIII of Lindblum in order to distance the princess from her increasingly hawkish adoptive mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria. Zidane and his cohorts travel to the kingdom of Alexandria aboard the airship \"Prima Vista\", ostensibly to perform a theatre play as a part of their plot to kidnap Princess Garnet.\n\nZidane Tribal\n\nWhile the rest of the crew is performing the play \"I Want to be Your Canary\" before Queen Brahne and her citizens, Zidane would use the cover to sneak in and attempt to kidnap the princess. He first encounters her when she tries to sneak out of the palace herself, and, at her request, promises to do his best to kidnap her. During the crew's escape flying out of the castle in the \"Prima Vista\" with the princess, the Queen's forces managed to damage the airship. From there, Zidane and his crew, along with Garnet, her stowaway bodyguard Adelbert Steiner, and a little black mage named Vivi all wind up crash-landing into a magical forest full of monsters. The group will commence their travel into a world-spanning adventure involving war, subterfuge, magical crystals, summoned monsters, and clones.",

She added that his relationship with female protagonist Garnet saves him from being considered \"abnormal\", and that the ultimate goal is for the players to relate to Zidane as best as possible. She added that no matter how the players proceed, Zidane always ends up forming a relationship with Garnet, and players are encouraged to insert themselves into the character as their avatar. Because of this, she questions how female and homosexual players would feel about their relationship, which she states would destroy the immersion. \"IGN\"'s Leah B. Jackson was more positive towards the relationship, finding the early premise that Garnet wanted to be kidnapped by Zidane intriguing.

Nevertheless, Oxford is satisfied by his overall character arc, noting that the surprise reveal of Zidane's true nature does tie into the game's narrative theme.

The matter consists of bread and wine.

In 1995, the International Anglican Liturgical Consultation involving liturgists from over half the provinces of the Anglican Communion unanimously agreed that:\n\nAnglican sacraments\n\nThe fundamental character of the eucharistic prayer is thanksgiving, and the whole eucharistic prayer should be seen as consecratory.

The first such conference took place at Lambeth in 1867.\n\nLambeth Conference\n\nAs the Anglican Communion is an international association of autonomous national and regional churches and is not a governing body, the Lambeth Conferences serve a collaborative and consultative function, expressing \"the mind of the communion\" on issues of the day.\n\nResolutions which a Lambeth Conference may pass are without legal effect, but they are nonetheless influential.

The possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the Church Missionary Society in 1851 when a number of US bishops were present in London. However, the initial impetus came from episcopal churches in Canada. In 1865 the synod of that province, in an urgent letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, (Charles Thomas Longley), represented the unsettlement of members of the Canadian church caused by recent legal decisions of the Privy Council and their alarm lest the revived action of convocation \"should leave us governed by canons different from those in force in England and Ireland, and thus cause us to drift into the status of an independent branch of the Catholic Church\". They therefore requested him to call a \"national synod of the bishops of the Anglican Church at home and abroad\", to meet under his leadership. After consulting both houses of the Convocation of Canterbury, Archbishop Longley assented and convened all the bishops of the Anglican Communion (then 144 in number) to meet at Lambeth in 1867.",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.\n\nIreland\n\nGeopolitically, the island of Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.\n\nIreland\n\nThe geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, with most of it being non-native conifer plantations. The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe.

This vessel was built at Paisley, on the Clyde, by Messrs. Fullerton and Co., and measures 165 tons register, carrying 420 tons coal under hatches, on a draught of only ten feet. This was the most important item in the instructions of the directors in sending for a vessel that could convey or bring from Morpeth, on the Hunter River, a large cargo on a given draught, and they have been most fortunate in securing a suitable craft in so short a time. In appearance the new steamer is a very fine wholesome vessel, having good ends, with a moderately flat floor. She is reported an excellent sea boat, and her outward passage speaks for itself with respect to her speed. The engines, which are on the compound surface condensing principle, are of 45 horse power , they are exceedingly strong but are so compact that they appear lost in the well ventilated and spacious engine room, but, although small in appearance, they are most effective, and can with ease drive the ship ten knots on the small consumption of 3 1\/2 tons per day She left England with 336 tons of coal, and has now on board about 40 tons, and has been under steam seventy eight day. These facts speak for themselves, and show that the \"Merkswort\"h is all that could be desired.

The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, which is their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months.\n\nMarch of the Penguins\n\nIt took one year for the two isolated cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jérôme Maison to shoot the documentary, which was shot around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Adélie Land.\n\n\"March of the Penguins\" was released in France on 26 January 2005 by Buena Vista International and in the United States by Warner Independent Pictures on 24 June 2005.

In the Middle Ages Ardahan served as an important transit point for goods arriving from the Abbasid Caliphate and departing to the regions around the Black Sea. During the 8th to 10th centuries the region was in hands of the Bagrationi princes of Tao-Klarjeti under the name of Artaani, and later part of Kingdom of Georgia between 11th to 15th centuries. According to the Arab historian Yahya of Antioch, the Byzantines razed Ardahan and slaughtered its population in 1021.\n\nArdahan\n\nThe Mongols took hold of the city in the 1230s but the Georgian princes of Samtskhe were able to recapture it in 1266. In 1555, by the Peace of Amasya, the western part of the principality of Samtskhe was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, and Ardahan was included into the \"sanjak\" of Ardahan (an overall part of the \"vilayet\" of Akhaltsikhe). The Ottomans turned Ardahan into a formidable fortress-town. In the 1640s the Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Ardahan and gave the following description: \"The fortress of Ardahan sits atop an inaccessible cliff. It is square-shaped and sturdy... This fortress has a cold climate and, because of this, there are no gardens or orchards. Fruits arrive from the fortress at Ajara and Tortum.\"",

As a result of Peace of Amasya, signed in 1555, Ardahan passed to Ottoman hands and reorganized into the Ardahan sanjak as part of eyalet of Childir. In 1578 Ottomans appointed the former Georgian prince, Manuchar (who took the name of \"Mustafa\" after converting to Islam) as the first governor. From 1625 onwards the entire eyalet was a hereditary possession of the now-Muslim atabegs of Samtskhe, which administered it as hereditary governors, with some exceptions, until the mid-18th century.",

Listed on the Record of Protected Structures for County Mayo, it is a 30-foot structure rising from a series of steps from the base nearly 40 feet in width. John Kilmaine of Alcester, England provides the following information on the structure: \"It is said that the pyramid is constructed on the old tumulus. The building of the pyramid is attributed to Sir John Browne the 7th Baronet and 1st Baron of Kilmaine, in memory of his brother, Sir George Browne. The structure, which at one time was crowned by a lead figure of Apollo, was designed by the Earl of Charlemont for his brother in law, Sir John Browne, The Neale\". There are a few varying stories of the building of the Pyramid. One such story is that Lord Kilmaine was anxious to find a way of relieving the extreme poverty of his tenants in the post famine years, so he employed several men to pick up the stones around the estate. He had those stones piled up and built into a pyramid. This provided the poor people with a little additional income. In the later years a wind-vane adorned the top of the pyramid, so the landlord could indulge in his passion for meteorology and the recording of weather systems over a period of 30 years. The Office of Public Works refurbished the Pyramid in 1990.",

He constructed a dam on Rancocas Creek to channel water through a raceway to power a gristmill and sawmill. Edward Gaskill and his sons dug the mill race on their property between 1720 and 1723. After the mills were established, more settlers were attracted to the area and built houses and commercial buildings on High, Church, White, Mill, and Pine streets, including the Shinn Curtis Log House (1712). By 1800, over 250 dwellings had been built.\n\nMount Holly, New Jersey\n\nToday no mills remain on the raceway, which still flows in its original course from the Rancocas just above the dam. The raceway proved a way for herring to make their way above the dam and was the scene of an annual fish run in the spring, which provided fresh herring for salting and eating. The former mill land has been preserved as the Mill Dam Park. It marks the importance of mills to the early settlements.",

Svobodová introduced Benešová to , a Francophilic Czech literary critic who would have profound national influence during the interwar period and who is now viewed as the founder of modern Czech criticism. According to Marcel Cornis-Pope and John Neubauer, \"The novelist Marie Pujmanová, who was a fairly close friend of Benešová's after the Great War, relates that young Benešová had enthusiastically read Dostoyevsky and Maupassant, but that, under the guidance of F.

Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns. The Emperor issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress. Fukuzawa Yukichi's descriptions of Western clothing and customs were influential. So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.

Though the poorest could still not afford to wear these flashy, high-status colours, those at the bottom of society also began to wear Western uniforms. Though those working practical jobs often wore tube-sleeved jackets, or else tied their kimono sleeves back with cords, the sleeves on kimono were considered an impractical safety hazard when working on machinery in factories, driving the switch towards Western clothing. In 1873, uniforms were introduced with as well.\n\nJapanese clothing during the Meiji period\n\nIn the early Meiji period, Western clothing was expensive, and was worn only by the richest in society. Wool had to be imported, and tailors familiar with the construction of Western clothing were difficult to find. It was more common, therefore, to wear some pieces of Western-style clothing instead of a whole outfit. (based on the French , 'hat'), along with a Western-style umbrella, were accessories commonly worn; for those with more money, leather shoes and watches were stylish contributions too.",

It is sometimes referred to as \"Ronda la Vieja\" (Old Ronda) despite the fact that Acinipo and Arunda (the original settlement of Ronda) co-existed for centuries.\n\nAcinipo\n\nHistory.\n\nSome historians assert that Acinipo was created after the battle of Munda (45 BC), fought between the armies of Julius Caesar and the army of Pompey's two sons, Gnaeus and Sextus. To Caesar, Munda was supposed to be a mop-up action after Pompey's main forces were defeated in Greece. But Munda was no mop-up exercise. Tens of thousands of Romans were killed on both sides; there was no decisive victory for Caesar's armies; and one of Pompey's sons, Sextus, fled to fight another day as a famous rebel pirate against Caesar's successor, Augustus.\n\nAcinipo\n\nSome Spanish historians state that Munda is the Roman name for Ronda, where the battle of Munda may have been fought. According to Pliny, the battle of Munda was fought in Osuna, about 50 km north of Ronda in the province of Seville. But there is general agreement that Acinipo was created for retired veterans of Caesar's legions, while Arunda (Ronda) would be a separate Roman outpost, perhaps created before the Munda conflict for the veterans of Pompey's legions.",

Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite.

Game 2 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was originally scheduled for Friday, May 5.

Thus, Game 2 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was moved to Saturday, May 6, while a tripleheader of the other three series was held on Sunday, May 7. This left several Edmonton fans to suffer cancelation\/rescheduling fees for flights and tickets as they were not initially aware of the NHL schedule change. As a result, Game 6 of the Edmonton–Vegas series was moved to Sunday, May 14; despite this being the lone game on that day, its start time was pushed to 10:00 p.m. ET so ESPN could air it after \"Sunday Night Baseball\".",

Following the 1054 Great Schism, both the Western Church and Eastern Church continued to consider themselves \"uniquely\" orthodox and catholic. Augustine wrote in On True Religion: \"Religion is to be sought... only among those who are called Catholic or orthodox Christians, that is, guardians of truth and followers of right.\" Over time, the Western Church gradually identified with the \"Catholic\" label, and people of Western Europe gradually associated the \"Orthodox\" label with the Eastern Church (although in some languages the \"Catholic\" label is not necessarily identified with the Western Church). This was in note of the fact that both Catholic and Orthodox were in use as ecclesiastical adjectives as early as the 2nd and 4th centuries respectively. Meanwhile, the extent of both Christendoms expanded, as Germanic peoples, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Scandinavia, Finnic peoples, Baltic peoples, British Isles and the other non-Christian lands of the northwest were converted by the Western Church, while Eastern Slavic peoples, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Russian territories, Vlachs and Georgia were converted by the Eastern Church.",

While the talented generals such as Nicephorus Phocas expanded the frontiers, the Macedonian emperors (such as Leo the Wise and Constantine VII) presided over the cultural flowering in Constantinople, known as the Macedonian Renaissance. The enlightened Macedonian rulers scorned the rulers of Western Europe as illiterate barbarians and maintained a nominal claim to rule over the West. Although this fiction had been exploded with the coronation of Charlemagne in Rome (800), the Byzantine rulers did not treat their Western counterparts as equals. Generally, they had little interest in political and economic developments in the barbarian (from their point of view) West.\n\nEarly Middle Ages\n\nAgainst this economic background the culture and the imperial traditions of the Eastern Roman Empire attracted its northern neighbours—Slavs, Bulgars, and Khazars—to Constantinople, in search of either pillage or enlightenment. The movement of the Germanic tribes to the south triggered the great migration of the Slavs, who occupied the vacated territories. In the 7th century, they moved westward to the Elbe, southward to the Danube and eastward to the Dnieper. By the 9th century, the Slavs had expanded into sparsely inhabited territories to the south and east from these natural frontiers, peacefully assimilating the indigenous Illyrian and Finnic populations.",

He was known for his distinctive pick-based style on the bass and for his imaginative lyrical contributions, including working class tales and numerous characters drawn from personal influences and Celtic culture.\n\nPhil Lynott\n\nLynott was born in the West Midlands of England but grew up in Dublin with his grandparents. He remained close to his mother, Philomena, throughout his life. He fronted several bands as a lead vocalist, including Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with \"Whiskey in the Jar\", the band had several hits in the mid-1970s, such as \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", \"Jailbreak\" and \"Waiting for an Alibi\", and became a popular live attraction combining Lynott's vocal and songwriting skills with dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott embarked upon a solo career and published two books of poetry. After Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band Grand Slam.",

In addition, they possess organised chromosomes that store genetic material.

His \"Madonna and Child with the Lamb\", inspired by Leonardo's \"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\", and \"A Grotesque Old Woman\" (or \"The Ugly Duchess\"), show the influence of Leonardo. This is regarded as evidence that Matsys was greatly influenced by Italian Renaissance artists and that he most likely travelled to Italy, at least for a brief period.\n\nLeonardeschi\n\nIn 1516 or 1517, Leonardo joined the court of Francis I of France. Coincidentally, a Flemish portrait painter, Joos van Cleve, also was summoned to the French court, where he painted the king, queen, and other courtiers. It is thought that Joos van Cleve had spent some time in Italy as well as France on this trip. Like Quentin Massys, a fellow artist of Antwerp, Joos van Cleve appropriated some themes and techniques of Leonardo da Vinci. Often, Joos van Cleve is called the \"Leonardo of the North\". Paintings by the Italian Renaissance artists Giampietrino (\"Madonna of the Cherries\") and Marco d'Oggiono (\"The Holy Infants Embracing\"), both assistants in the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci, were a major influence on the Antwerp master. Joos van Cleve produced numerous versions of his own paintings after these models, adapting them to his own style and so creating some of the most successful compositions of the time in northern Europe. His son, Cornelis van Cleve, continued an artistic interest in Leonardo, producing several copies of his father's work and the \"Madonna of the Yarnwinder\".",

It has been attributed to Correggio since the late 19th century.\n\nBolognini Madonna\n\nIn 1865, the painting was left by Gian Giacomo Attendolo Bolognini (for whom the painting is now named) to the Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco in Milan, where it now hangs. It is compositionally related to the artist's \"Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist\".\n\nBolognini Madonna\n\nDescription and style.\n\nIn the painting, a room with a pilaster decorated by candelabras in low relief opens onto a distant river landscape, far behind the portrait subject. Seated and at half figure, the Madonna holds the Baby Jesus in her lap as he plays with a young Saint John the Baptist who is handing him a cross—symbol of the future sacrifice of Jesus. The painting represents one of many variants on the theme of the meeting of Saint John and the Baby Jesus, a theme dear to Leonardo da Vince and to his Milanese Leonardeschi circle. The painting, in fact, is an example of the Leonardic influence on the young Correggio, both in the physical depiction of the Madonna, and in the landscape and the use of sfumato. The sfumato smudging is accentuated by the effects of shadows as in the veil of Marie that, hanging from the side of her head, casts a melancholy shadow over her face.",

It was founded by Yi Seong-gye in July 1392 and replaced by the Korean Empire in October 1897. The kingdom was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of Goryeo in what is today the city of Kaesong. Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day Seoul. The kingdom's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amrok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens.\n\nJoseon\n\nDuring its 500-year duration, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society. Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new state's ideology. Buddhism was accordingly discouraged, and occasionally Buddhists faced persecutions. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the Korean peninsula and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. In the 1590s, the kingdom was severely weakened due to Japanese invasions. Several decades later, Joseon was invaded by the Later Jin dynasty and the Qing dynasty in 1627 and 1636–1637 respectively, leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the \"hermit kingdom\" in Western literature. After the end of these invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and technological development. What power the kingdom recovered during its isolation waned as the 18th century came to a close. Faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure, and rebellions at home, the kingdom declined rapidly in the late 19th century.",

Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or \"perching\" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.",

He is widely considered one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School.

He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941.\n\nArnold Schoenberg\n\nSchoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, has shaped much of 20th-century musical thought. Many composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking, whereas others have passionately reacted against it.\n\nArnold Schoenberg\n\nSchoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century classical music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.",

On November 28 the Montreal city council voted in favour (40–22) of renaming Park Avenue after Bourassa. If, as had been expected, Quebec's Toponymy Commission had approved the name change, all of Park Avenue and its continuation, Bleury, would have been renamed Robert Bourassa Avenue. This would have caused the newly named street to intersect René Lévesque Boulevard, named after a long time political rival to Bourassa. That boulevard, in turn, had been renamed from Dorchester Boulevard in 1987, in a decision that was also not without controversy. This decision by the City of Montreal without any consultation with the people of the city caused an immediate controversy, though many of those opposed to the change considered it a \"fait accompli\". The proposal spawned substantial grass-roots opposition, both because of the lack of prior citizen input and because Park is itself a meaningful street name, associated with the city's Mount Royal park. In addition to protests and active opposition by a committee of Montreal residents and businesses opposed to the name change, an online petition garnered more than 18,000 virtual signatures against this renaming. On February 5, 2007, Montreal mayor Gérald Tremblay withdrew his proposal to rename Park Avenue. However, there is a Robert Bourassa Blvd., located in the Duvernay district of Laval, Quebec.",

Its name in English is \"gee\" (pronounced ), plural \"gees\".\n\nG\n\nHistory.\n\nThe evolution of the Latin alphabet's G can be traced back to the Latin alphabet's predecessor, the Greek alphabet. The voiced velar stop was represented by the third letter of the Greek alphabet, gamma (Γ), which was later adopted by the Etruscan language. Latin then borrowed this \"rounded form\" of gamma, C, to represent the same sound in words such as \"recei\", which was likely an early dative form of \"rex\", meaning \"king,\" as found in an \"early Latin inscription.\" Over time, however, the letter C shifted to represent the unvoiced velar stop, leading to the displacement of the letter K. Scholars believe that this change can be attributed to the influence of the Etruscan language on Latin.\n\nG\n\nAfterwards, the letter 'G' was introduced in the Old Latin period as a variant of 'C' to distinguish voiced \/ɡ\/ from voiceless \/k\/, and G was used to represent a voiced velar from this point on and C \"stood for the unvoiced velar only\".\n\nThe recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga, who added letter G to the teaching of the Roman alphabet during the 3rd century BC: he was the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, around 230 BCE. At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both \/ɡ\/ and \/k\/ before open vowels, had come to express \/k\/ in all environments.",

With the military victory at Munda and the deaths of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompeius (eldest son of Pompey), Caesar was politically able to return in triumph to Rome, and then govern as the elected Roman dictator. Subsequently, the assassination of Julius Caesar began the Republican decline that led to the Roman Empire, initiated with the reign of the emperor Augustus.\n\nBattle of Munda\n\nPrelude.\n\nThe republicans had initially been led by Pompey, until the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC and Pompey's death soon afterwards. However, in April 46 BC, Caesar's forces destroyed the Pompeian army at the Battle of Thapsus.\n\nBattle of Munda\n\nAfter this, military opposition to Caesar was confined to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal). During the Spring of 46 BC, two legions in Hispania Ulterior, largely formed by former Pompeian veterans enrolled in Caesar's army, had declared themselves for Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great) and driven out Caesar's proconsul. Soon they were joined by the remnants of the Pompeian army. These forces were commanded by the brothers Gnaeus and Sextus Pompeius (sons of Pompey), Publius Attius Varus and by the talented general Titus Labienus, who had been one of the most trusted of Caesar's generals during the Gallic Wars. Using the resources of the province, they were able to raise an army of four legions. These were the two original veteran legions, a legion formed from the survivors of Thapsus, and an additional legion recruited from Roman citizens and local inhabitants. They took control of almost all Hispania Ulterior, including the important Roman colonies of Italica and Corduba (the capital of the province). Caesar's generals Quintus Fabius Maximus and Quintus Pedius did not risk a battle, and remained encamped at Obulco (present-day Porcuna), about east of Corduba, requesting help from Caesar.",

In Handsworth near Sheffield, he began producing steel in 1740 after years of experimenting in secret. Huntsman's system used a coke-fired furnace capable of reaching 1,600 °C, into which up to twelve clay crucibles, each capable of holding about 15 kg of iron, were placed. When the crucibles or \"pots\" were white-hot, they were charged with lumps of blister steel, an alloy of iron and carbon produced by the cementation process, and a flux to help remove impurities. The pots were removed after about 3 hours in the furnace, impurities in the form of slag skimmed off, and the molten steel poured into moulds to end up as cast ingots. Complete melting of the steel produced a highly uniform crystal structure upon cooling, which gave the metal increased tensile strength and hardness in comparison with other steels being made at the time.\n\nCrucible steel\n\nBefore the introduction of Huntsman's technique, Sheffield produced about 200 tonnes of steel per year from Swedish wrought iron (see Oregrounds iron). The introduction of Huntsman's technique changed this radically: one hundred years later the amount had risen to over 80,000 tonnes per year, or almost half of Europe's total production.

Huntsman used coke rather than coal or charcoal, achieving temperatures high enough to melt steel and dissolve iron. Huntsman's process differed from some of the wootz processes in that it used a longer time to melt the steel and to cool it down and thus allowed more time for the diffusion of carbon. Huntsman's process used iron and steel as raw materials, in the form of blister steel, rather than direct conversion from cast iron as in puddling or the later Bessemer process. The ability to fully melt the steel removed any inhomogeneities in the steel, allowing the carbon to dissolve evenly into the liquid steel and negating the prior need for extensive blacksmithing in an attempt to achieve the same result. Similarly, it allowed steel to be cast by pouring into molds. The use of fluxes allowed nearly complete extraction of impurities from the liquid, which could then simply float to the top for removal. This produced the first steel of modern quality, providing a means of efficiently changing excess wrought iron into useful steel. Huntsman's process greatly increased the European output of quality steel suitable for use in items like knives, tools, and machinery, helping to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution.",

He made one first-class appearance for a team playing as Yorkshire against Lancashire at Sheffield in 1851. He scored 47 runs in his seven matches, with a high score of 16.\n\nBenjamin Huntsman (cricketer)\n\nOutside of cricket, Huntsman was a proprietor of land and houses, in addition to owning the Tinsley Park Collieries. During the Strike of 1869–70, he locked out his miners and employed non-union staff. He was a member of the 1st West Yorkshire Yeomanry, having been appointed as a cornet in May 1852. He gained the rank of lieutenant in April 1856, before being promoted to captain in March 1862. He resigned his commission in February 1872. He was also an alderman of the city of Nottingham and was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in May 1887. Huntsman died in June 1893 at West Retford, Nottinghamshire. His great-grandfather was Benjamin Huntsman, the inventor and manufacturer of cast or crucible steel.",

A diesel generator supplied power to parts of Portree, while the village of Broadford was supplied from the power station at Nostie Bridge on the Scottish mainland by a cable that run for under the sea. A switching-on ceremony was held at Kyleakin on 6 May 1947, to inaugurate the undersea supply from Nostie to Broadford, at which Lady Mackenzie presided. The cable was sized to supply 85 per cent of the population of Skye, but once the formal opening ceremony had been completed, Edward MacColl, the chief executive of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, was able to anounce that the Storr Lochs scheme had just been approved by the Electricity Commissioners.\n\nStorr Lochs Hydro-Electric Scheme\n\nThe Board received permission to proceed with the construction of the project in late 1949, and work began in early 1950. Water was supplied by Loch Fada and Loch Leathan, which are situated between the main road from Portree to Staffin and the sea. The turbine house was located on the shore at Bearreraig Bay, separated from the lochs by a cliff. In order to overcome the difficulties of accessing this site, a funicular railway was built at the start of the project, and used to transport men and materials down to the shore. The formation for the railway included 647 steps cast into the concrete. The railway is standard gauge with a maximum gradient of 1 in 2, and an electric winch controls the movement of the single carriage. Prior to its construction, the Board anticipated that materials could be brought to the beach by landing craft, but the loss of one vessel and all the equipment it was carrying due to the fierce tides resulted in this approach being abandoned.",

In 1956, the scheme was upgraded. The single pipeline was duplicated, and a third 1 MW generator was added in the turbine house. Subsequently, Loch Fada was connected to Loch Leathan by constructing a channel between the two, so that its water could be used to supplement the supply from Loch Leathan at times when rainfall was low.\n\nStorr Lochs Hydro-Electric Scheme\n\nThe station could produce 2.85 MW of power.

Its surface level is AOD.\n\nStorr Lochs Hydro-Electric Scheme\n\nUpgrade.\n\nAfter nearly 70 years of operation, during which time it produced around 8 GWh of power per year, the station was becoming difficult to maintain, and the lack of automation meant that site visits were necessary whenever adjustments needed to be made. In the mid 2010s Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), who inherited the scheme when the electricity industry was privatised, decided that a complete upgrade of the station was necessary. The original turbines were replaced by two new ones, supplied by Voith Group, which incorporate automatic adjustment of the guide vanes by an autonomous hydraulic control unit. It was the first time that this system had been used for a small hydro-electricity plant. Most of the testing could be carried out off-site, significantly reducing disruption to the generation of power.",

A dam was constructed across the Bearreraig River to raise the level of Loch Leathan, which included screens to prevent debris entering the pipeline. A long wing wall was built across the surrounding hillside, to provide additional stability to the dam, because of the boggy nature of the terrain.

The consulting engineers were Blyth and Blyth of Edinburgh, while construction was carried out by James Miller and Partners, also from Edinburgh. The official opening took place on 31 May 1952, when Lady Rachel Stuart, wife of the Secretary of State for Scotland, James Stuart, started the turbines. Tom Johnston was by this time chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, and used the occasion to say that despite those who felt that electricity was unnecessary, because the Highlanders were satisfied with their oil lamps, 850 houses were already connected to the grid, and this total would rise to 2500 during 1953.. The cost of the scheme was £247,000, and initially it could supply 5.5 GWh of electricity per year. The population of Skye at the time was 10,500.",

However, the Rams — and Warner in particular — lit up defenses throughout the league. Warner threw 41 touchdown passes, setting a new franchise mark, and his 109.2 quarterback rating was the third highest (for a minimum of 200 attempts) in a season next to Joe Montana (112.4) and Steve Young (112.8). (The record now is owned solely by Aaron Rodgers after his record-breaking 2011 season.)\n\nThe Greatest Show on Turf\n\nThe Rams finished 13–3, a franchise best record for the 16 game schedule, which the 2001 Rams would break when they finished 14–2. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz's innovative variation on the Coryell offensive system suited Warner well; he threw only 13 interceptions during the regular season. For his innovation, Martz would be regarded as one of the most ingenious coordinators of his time. The Rams first demolished the Minnesota Vikings in in a shoot-out, where Warner burned the Minnesota secondary for 391 yards and five touchdowns en route to victory. In , the Rams faced the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, coached by Tony Dungy. Facing one of the league's best defenses, Warner had one of the worst postseason performances of his career, throwing three interceptions to the heavily loaded Buccaneers secondary which featured John Lynch, Donnie Abraham, and Ronde Barber. However, the Rams proved they were more than just a good offensive team, as they prevented Tampa Bay from scoring any touchdowns, allowed only two field goals, and intercepted Shaun King twice. Trailing 6–5 late in the 4th quarter, Warner engineered the game-winning drive culminating in the go-ahead touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl to send the Rams to the Super Bowl with an 11–6 victory.",

Sociological studies in the 1960s and 1970s helped to re-examine and dispel these stereotypes. Stereotypes about Appalachian people being ignorant, anti-progress, and racist are still grappled in the region by portrayals in media and press publications.",

Donahue was an ex-cop discharged for not giving into corruption, now working for the Inter-State Detective Agency. From 1930 to 1935, Nebel wrote 15 Donahue stories for \"Black Mask\".\n\nFrederick Nebel\n\nFrom 1931 to 1937, Nebel wrote nearly 50 stories for \"Dime Detective\" featuring the character Jack Cardigan, a tough, Irish detective working for the Cosmos Detective Agency in St. Louis.\n\nOther series characters created by Nebel include: Bill Gales and Mike McGill for \"Air Stories\", Brinkhaus for \"Detective Fiction Weekly\", Corporate Chet Tyson for \"Northwest Stories\", and The Driftin’ Kid for Lariat.\n\nNebel sometimes wrote under the pen names Lewis Nebel, Eric Lewis and Grimes Hill, a name derived from Grymes Hill, near where he was born on Staten Island.\n\nNovels and screen adaptations.\n\nIn 1933, Little, Brown published Nebel’s first novel, \"Sleepers East\", based on his early experience as a brakeman on passenger trains. The thriller is set entirely on a ten-hour train ride from the Midwest to New York. \"The New York Times\", while critical of the genre conventions of a story set on a train, praised Nebel for providing \"thrills a-plenty.\" \"Though lacking credibility as to plot, the story has full measure of action, suspense and emotional conflict.\" The novel was later adapted to the screen as \"Sleepers West\" (1941). In 1934, he wrote \"But Not the End\", a novel set in Depression-era New York City. The book was praised for its \"brilliant divergences from the standardized patterns of depression era fiction. In 1936, he wrote the novel \"Fifty Roads to Town\". \"The New York Times\" wrote,\"This is a first rate, virile piece of story-telling. It moves dramatically but in a restrained and effective manner toward its ultimate goal.\" It was adapted into a comedy film of the same name starring Don Ameche in 1937.",

In 1926, Nebel sold his first \"Black Mask\" story, “The Breaks of the Game,” to editor Phil Cody. That same year Joseph Shaw took over as editor, and throughout his tenure with the magazine, he mentored Nebel as he published his work. Over the next 12 years, Nebel published at a fast pace, writing up to 5000 words a day, while publishing in \"Black Mask\" and numerous other pulp magazines, including \"Action Stories\", \"Danger Trail\", \"Dime Detective\" and \"Sea Stories\".\n\nFrederick Nebel\n\nShaw encouraged his authors to develop series characters, and Nebel created the detective duo of Captain Steve MacBride and newspaper reporter Kennedy of fictional “Richmond City”. MacBride was a hardboiled homicide detective while drunken, wisecracking Kennedy provided comic relief. The pair was featured in 36 of Nebel’s stories spanning 8 years.[6] In the 1930s, Nebel sold the rights to MacBride and Kennedy stories to Warner Bros. who made ten film adaptations. The CBS Radio series \"Meet MacBride\", beginning in 1936, was also adapted from the series.",

His intellectual variations of words depend on most complex associations. His boundless growth of linguistic flowers has its roots in the swamp of our civilization. Nebel searched for, and found, an archetype of expression in a so-far-undiscovered world of forms. Nebel's Fugues are unique through a self-imposed discipline. In order to intensify the power of the word he concentrated on words composed of 9 letters of the alphabet only for his first Fugue, \"Unfeig\" (Brave) and of 12 letters for the second Fugue, \"Das Rad der Titanen\" (The Wheel of the Titans). He explains this attempt to counteract the lack of expression in the outworn language of our time.\n\nOtto Nebel\n\n\"Unfeig Oblong Format standing like trees. To associate Nebel's return to runic characters with romantic, Wagnerian, or worse, Hitlerian, Teutonism would be a misunderstanding of his purpose, the search of simplicity. There is more and deeper affinity to pictorial values in his literary work. Nebel designed the book \"Unfeig\" in an oblong format. The poems stand like trees, upright. As a painter he transposes the letters into small colored squares on the last folding leaf of his book. Nebel at the completion of his 70th year looks back upon an oeuvre of 7000 leaves of drawings and series of drawings, 2000 painted and graphic leaves, 200 paintings, many unpublished books and writings, several printed books. (Forthcoming is \"Die Goldene Spur\", The Golden Track, Arcade Press.) At the present time, another book is forthcoming, small of format, but great significance. It is the Fugue of 12 runic characters, \"das Rad der Titanen\" (The Wheel of the Titans).

Schieffelin was captured in 1779 and held prisoner in Williamsburg, Virginia. He escaped to Canada, where in 1780 he was appointed a lieutenant in the Queen's Rangers by Henry Clinton. He spent time in Montreal and Detroit, before returning to New York, where in 1794 he founded a drug company with his brother Lawrence.

The son of former West Perth and Subiaco player Don Marinko, Sr., Marinko excelled at junior football, and began his career at West Perth in 1954, at the age of 18. He transferred to East Perth in 1957, and spent two seasons with the club before transferring back to West Perth, where he remained until his retirement in 1965. Overall, Marinko played 160 senior games for West Perth, including the 1960 premiership, and 24 for East Perth, in a number of different positions.\n\nRay Marinko\n\nCareer.\n\nMarinko was the son of Don Marinko, Sr., who played 194 games with West Perth between 1926 and 1939, and the brother of Don Marinko, Jr., with whom he later played at West Perth. An excellent junior footballer, Marinko played under-18 football for the West Perth Cobbers in the Young Sports Temperance League at the age of 18, and also captained the under-15 side at the same time. In 1953, having begun playing for Mount Hawthorn in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (MJFA), he was selected in representative side to tour Victoria. The youngest member of the team, Marinko stayed with former Collingwood player Gordon Coventry while in Melbourne, thus avoiding the troubles of his teammates, who had their clothes stolen whilst staying at a YMCA. Joining his brother in the team, Marinko made his senior debut for West Perth against East Fremantle in round one of the 1954 season, having replaced the injured Brian Falconer. He played a total of 22 games in his first season, alternating between centre and the half-back and half-forward flanks. Marinko was known for his exceptional footpassing, with \"The West Australian\" noting that his main attribute was \"accurate kicking with either foot\". Having established himself as a regular in West Perth's senior side, he was also strong overhead, with a spectacular mark over East Fremantle's Ray French during the 1956 season said to be equal to John Gerovich's famous mark over the same player, although no documentary evidence of the mark has survived.",

Given the lower sea levels in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene it is likely that Trinidad was close enough to the South American mainland to allow settlement that would not have necessarily required a watercraft. Thus the early migration of Trinidad should be considered differently when compared to the migration of other Caribbean Islands. With the help of radiocarbon dating Napolitano and colleagues (2019) have discovered two distinct clusters of Caribbean colonisation, from ca. 3850–550 BCE and 150–1450 AD. The first cluster represents two distinct population dispersals between 3850 and 550 BCE. Within this time frame the earliest settled islands are Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico in the Greater Antilles; Guadeloupe, Sint Maarten, Vieques, Saint Thomas, Barbuda, Antigua and Montserrat in the northern Lesser Antilles; Barbados and Grenada in the southern Lesser Antilles; and Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao and Tobago, which are located in close proximity to the South American mainland. Further radiocarbon dates that were not used in the study by Napolitano and colleagues suggest that Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Mona Island in the Greater Antilles; Anguila, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Marie-Galante and Martinique in the northern Lesser Antilles; and Margarita, Coche Island and Cubagua in the southern Lesser Antilles were also colonised in the time period from ca. 3850–550 BCE. Early paleoenvironmental evidence including evidence of man-made fires from numerous Caribbean Islands has shown that by approximately 3190 BCE many if not all islands in the Lesser Antilles up to Antigua were being visited, if not settled.",

Champions nearly always came from the northeast United States, primarily the Pittsburgh area, northeast Ohio, central Pennsylvania, and Maine. The Detroit program enjoyed a period of dominance in the tournament's latter years and remains one of the largest and most competitive WBQA-affiliated organizations today. The “World finals” tournament is now held annually in the Chicago area each year in early April, and registration is open to any team. Other major tournaments include the Great Lakes Regional Tournament in November, and the All-Timers tournament, open to both children and adults, in January.",

All questions must be grammatically correct (with the exception of questions beginning with \"what if\"). This is the same style of question used in other groups such as Bible Quiz Fellowship.\n\nBible quiz\n\nWBQA operates in close cooperation with numerous independent local leagues in the Great Lakes region, such as Detroit Bible Quizzing, Huron Valley Bible Quizzing in the Ann Arbor area, the Ohio Bible Quizzing Association centered around Chillicothe, the Shenango Valley Bible Quiz league around the Pittsburgh area, BIC (Brethren in Christ) Quizzing in the Harrisburg region, and Rochester Youth for Christ Quizzing around Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nWBQA quizzing held a “World finals” tournament in summer from 1974 to 2010, usually at a midwestern Christian college or university. Champions nearly always came from the northeast United States, primarily the Pittsburgh area, northeast Ohio, central Pennsylvania, and Maine. The Detroit program enjoyed a period of dominance in the tournament's latter years and remains one of the largest and most competitive WBQA-affiliated organizations today. The “World finals” tournament is now held annually in the Chicago area each year in early April, and registration is open to any team. Other major tournaments include the Great Lakes Regional Tournament in November, and the All-Timers tournament, open to both children and adults, in January.",

For example, both natural deduction and sequent calculus systems facilitate the elimination and introduction of universal and existential quantifiers so that unquantified logical expressions can be manipulated according to the much simpler rules of propositional calculus. In a typical argument, quantifiers are eliminated, then propositional calculus is applied to unquantified expressions (which typically contain free variables), and then the quantifiers are reintroduced. This very much parallels the way in which mathematical proofs are carried out in practice by mathematicians. Predicate calculus proofs are generally much easier to discover with this approach, and are often shorter. Natural deduction systems are more suited to practical theorem-proving. Sequent calculus systems are more suited to theoretical analysis.\n\nSequent calculus\n\nOverview.\n\nIn proof theory and mathematical logic, sequent calculus is a family of formal systems sharing a certain style of inference and certain formal properties. The first sequent calculi systems, LK and LJ, were introduced in 1934\/1935 by Gerhard Gentzen as a tool for studying natural deduction in first-order logic (in classical and intuitionistic versions, respectively). Gentzen's so-called \"Main Theorem\" (\"Hauptsatz\") about LK and LJ was the cut-elimination theorem, a result with far-reaching meta-theoretic consequences, including consistency. Gentzen further demonstrated the power and flexibility of this technique a few years later, applying a cut-elimination argument to give a (transfinite) proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic, in surprising response to Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Since this early work, sequent calculi, also called Gentzen systems, and the general concepts relating to them, have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic, and automated deduction.",

This allows one to show consistency of the sequent calculus easily; if the empty sequent were derivable it would have to be a subformula of some premise, which it is not.

In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using transfinite induction up to an ordinal called ε0. Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε0 can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a Turing machine describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.",

This other system, today called \"primitive recursive arithmetic with the additional principle of quantifier-free transfinite induction up to the ordinal ε0\", is neither weaker nor stronger than the system of Peano axioms. Gentzen argued that it avoids the questionable modes of inference contained in Peano arithmetic and that its consistency is therefore less controversial.\n\nGentzen's consistency proof\n\nGentzen's theorem.\n\nGentzen's theorem is concerned with first-order arithmetic: the theory of the natural numbers, including their addition and multiplication, axiomatized by the first-order Peano axioms. This is a \"first-order\" theory: the quantifiers extend over natural numbers, but not over sets or functions of natural numbers.

However, modified versions of Hilbert's program emerged and research has been carried out on related topics. This has led, in particular, to:\n\nProof theory\n\nIn parallel to the rise and fall of Hilbert's program, the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded. Jan Łukasiewicz suggested in 1926 that one could improve on Hilbert systems as a basis for the axiomatic presentation of logic if one allowed the drawing of conclusions from assumptions in the inference rules of the logic. In response to this, Stanisław Jaśkowski (1929) and Gerhard Gentzen (1934) independently provided such systems, called calculi of natural deduction, with Gentzen's approach introducing the idea of symmetry between the grounds for asserting propositions, expressed in introduction rules, and the consequences of accepting propositions in the elimination rules, an idea that has proved very important in proof theory. Gentzen (1934) further introduced the idea of the sequent calculus, a calculus advanced in a similar spirit that better expressed the duality of the logical connectives, and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic, and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic. Together, the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory.",

Peter Opsvik is also the designer, in cooperation with Hans Christian Mengshoel, of the original \"Balans\" kneeling chair.\n\nTripp Trapp\n\nDevelopment history.\n\nPeter Opsvik noticed that his son Tor had no chair that could position him at the correct height at the family dinner table and enable him to participate with the rest of the family. He then developed a chair that was adjustable and changed with the size of his son as he grew bigger.\n\nTripp Trapp\n\nTripp Trapp did not sell well in the beginning, but a news segment on Norwegian television in 1974 sparked an interest that has gained strength over the years. By 2016 Tripp Trapp had sold more than 10 million chairs.\n\nTripp Trapp\n\nProduct characteristics.\n\nTripp Trapp has a seat and footrest that can be adjusted in both height and depth. Thus the chair can be adapted as the child grows. Additionally the chair is correctly spaced and so stable that even a young toddler can climb up into the chair safely by themselves. The Tripp Trapp high chair is made from beechwood with some limited editions in oak.",

In some cases, this figure is approximate and may vary slightly between sources depending on which islands are counted. The criteria for inclusion appear to differ considerably between the countries so they are not necessarily directly comparable. Different languages use different words for islands depending on size and or shape and elevation. For example, in English, a smaller island can be referred to as an islet, skerry, cay, or eyot, leading to confusion over classification as an island in some circumstances. This can influence which islands are counted or not. Some islands are fully submerged by the tides at times, and those may also not be counted by some countries while others do. Where counts vary, this article uses the highest reliably sourced figure.\n\nList of countries by number of islands\n\nFor the purposes of this article, the top 50 countries will have their islands determined by the following definition: “An island is a land mass permanently above sea level either in an inland waterway or in the open sea.

An experimental blend of comedy and tragedy, Yuan's story followed a group of young friends whose lack of financial means and social status frustrated their dreams of happiness, including a girl singer, her prostitute sister, and her soldier lover, home briefly between fighting the Japanese occupying north China. The film, released shortly before Japan invaded Shanghai and initiated the Second Sino-Japanese War in summer 1937, became a massive hit with audiences. Subsequently, \"Street Angel\" was seen to mark one of the last products of the \"golden age of Chinese cinema\" of the 1930s, before artists were forced to retreat to Shanghai's foreign concessions and finally came under Japanese propaganda control.",

Starring popular Chinese actor Zhao Dan (赵丹) and iconic Chinese singer Zhou Xuan (周璇), the story is set in the slums of Shanghai, chronicling the lives of a band of downtrodden underclass outcasts: a tea house singer, a trumpet player, a newspaper hawker, and a prostitute. By blending elements of romance, comedy and melodrama into the storyline, the characters find themselves in a variety of difficult situations as they try to navigate the hardships of the city during the 1930s. Released towards the end of the golden age of Shanghai cinema, the film is regarded as a masterpiece of the Chinese left-wing movement. Taking place during a time of national tension within the country, issues such as economic policy and military conflict are explored to raise awareness about some of China's most pressing concerns. Additionally, the depiction of an impoverished neighborhood in the midst of a contemporary city is a compelling examination of how modernization had affected China during this era. This fusion between the two also provides a commentary on the combined effects that modernization and colonialism had on Shanghai specifically.",

When the military conflict between China and Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, the film was exemplarily in solidifying the mainstream status of 'new citizen' films through its thematic music, singing and choreographic art. The film also strengthened classical production types and promoted the national spirit by encouraging Chinese citizens and filmmakers to bypass the destruction that the war brought to national culture in Japanese invaded areas. The realist demonstration of voicelessness amongst the common people surviving in Shanghai let \"Street Angel\" lay a foundation of thought and art for the rapid restoration of post-war Chinese film.\n\nStreet Angel (1937 film)\n\n\"Street Angel\" is now considered a vivid portrait of Shanghai street life in the 1930s, \"capturing the earthy energy and wild collective mood swings\" that existed in Shanghai culture prior to the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The male lead Zhao Dan described \"Street Angel\" as \"a film about the lowest strata of society in Shanghai” that has now become one of the classics of the \"leftist\" filmmaking period in China, which reached its peak in the 1930s. In 2005, \"Street Angel\" was selected as one of the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures by the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards, ranked 11th.",

One sequence in particular, where Xiao Chen and his friends attempt to act as barbers, reveals a moment of slapstick or physical comedy in the otherwise dolorous third act.\n\nStreet Angel (1937 film)\n\nThe film also features several significant musical interludes. Two original songs featured in \"Street Angel\" are \"Song of the Four Seasons\" (四季歌) and \"The Wandering Songstress\" (天涯歌女), both composed by He Lüting, with lyrics by Tian Han. He Luting adapted the scores from two urban folk ballads from Suzhou, \"Crying on the Seventh Seven Day Cycle\" (哭七七) and \"One Who Knows Me Well\" (知心客) respectively. Like the character of Xiao Hong, Zhou Xuan herself had barely escaped being sold: at the age of ten, she managed to avoid being sold to a brothel, and was instead apprenticed to a song and dance troupe based in Shanghai. She became known as the \"golden voice\", and after she performed the two aforementioned songs in the film, they became popularized and have come to be recognized as musical expressions of turbulent 1930s-era life in China. These two songs continue to be considered two of the most famous songs in modern Chinese culture, and amongst other popular songs at the time, were used to express and emphasize national Chinese characteristics, distinguishing Chinese culture from that of the West.",

         "context": "Street Angel (1937 film)\n\nAnalysis.\n\n\"Street Angel\", a story of solidarity, friendship, and love amongst the dregs of urban society, can be interpreted in different ways. The film successfully \"describe[s] the wide gulf between rich and poor in the city\" by presenting both bourgeois and proletarian in the Shanghai urban society. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Chinese Film\", Malu Tianshi is \"certainly a critique of Shanghai's semi-colonialist society…” in an allegorical and indirect way. Moreover, it has even been described as a Chinese forerunner of Italian neo-realism that offers the audience the inclination to an alternative modernity. As a canonized leftist film, \"Street Angel\" constructs allegories to educate the masses to be modern subjects. It, also combines Hollywood and Soviet film techniques with traditional Chinese narrative arts. Although the title recalls Frank Borzage's film of the same name from 1928, some scholars believe the film to have been inspired by Borzage's 1927 film Seventh Heaven. In addition to the clear American inspiration, the notable Soviet influence appears in such formal choices as the extensive use of quick cuts of close-ups, and in the visually-captivating opening sequence. These techniques are often seen in other classic films such as the 1935 film \"City Scenes\" (都市风光). Accordingly, the dazzling three-minute opening sequence of \"Street Angel\" displays “a key trope of the cinematic portrayal of 1930s Shanghai: the simultaneous existence of competing forces from different colonial powers.” Moreover, film scholars such as Guo-Juin Hong emphasized that the “tensions among various visual and aural elements are arranged in an ostensibly chronological order, a form also popular in the European avant-garde cinema of the 1920s.”",
