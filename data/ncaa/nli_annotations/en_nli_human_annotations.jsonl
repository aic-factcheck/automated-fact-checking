{"claim":"A drone might evoke a rustic or archaic atmosphere of Scottish music.","context":"Drone (sound)\n\nUse in musical compositions.\n\nComposers of Western classical music occasionally used a drone (especially one on open fifths) to evoke a rustic or archaic atmosphere, perhaps echoing that of Scottish or other early or folk music. Examples include the following:\n\nDrone (sound)\n\nThe best-known drone piece in the concert repertory is the Prelude to Wagner's \"Das Rheingold\" (1854) wherein low horns and bass instruments sustain an E♭ throughout the entire movement. The atmospheric ostinato effect that opens Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which inspired similar gestures in the opening of all the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, represents a gesture derivative of drones.\n\nDrone (sound)\n\nOne consideration for composers of common practice keyboard music was equal temperament. The adjustments lead to slight mistunings as heard against a sustained drone. Even so, drones have often been used to spotlight dissonance purposefully.\n\nDrone (sound)\n\nModern concert musicians make frequent use of drones, often with just or other non-equal tempered tunings. Drones are a regular feature in the music of composers indebted to the chant tradition, such as Arvo Pärt, Sofia Gubaidulina, and John Tavener. The single-tones that provided the impetus for minimalism through the music of La Monte Young and many of his students qualify as drones. David First, the band Coil, the early experimental compilations of John Cale (\"Sun Blindness Music\", Dream Interpretation, and \"Stainless Gamelan\"), Pauline Oliveros and Stuart Dempster, Alvin Lucier (\"Music On A Long Thin Wire\"), Ellen Fullman, Lawrence Chandler and Arnold Dreyblatt all make notable use of drones. The music of Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi is essentially drone-based. Shorter drones or the general concept of a continuous element are often used by many other composers. Other composers whose music is entirely based on drones include Charlemagne Palestine and Phill Niblock. \"The Immovable Do\" by Percy Grainger contains a sustained high C (heard in the upper woodwinds) that lasts for the entirety of the piece. Drone pieces also include Loren Rush's \"Hard Music\" (1970) and Folke Rabe's \"Was??\" (1968), as well as Robert Erickson's \"Down at Piraeus\". The avant-garde guitarist Glenn Branca also used drones extensively. French singer Camille uses a continuous B throughout her album Le_Fil.","label":"s","PVI":"1.5238116","annotated_label":"s","source":"QACGEN","date":"240318_174628","acceptable_error":false}

{"claim":"The name of the D4Z4 regulatory element transcripts is D4Z4.","context":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy\n\n\"DUX4\" consists of three exons. Exons 1 and 2 are in each repeat. Exon 3 is in the pLAM region telomeric to the last partial repeat. Multiple RNA transcripts are produced from the D4Z4 repeat array, both sense and antisense. Some transcripts might be degraded in areas to produce si-like small RNAs. Some transcripts that originate centromeric to the D4Z4 repeat array at the non-deleted element (NDE), termed D4Z4 regulatory element transcripts (DBE-T), could play a role in \"DUX4\" derepression. One proposed mechanism is that DBE-T leads to the recruitment of the trithorax-group protein Ash1L, an increase in H3K36me2-methylation, and ultimately de-repression of 4q35 genes.\n\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy\n\nFSHD1.\n\nFSHD involving deletion of D4Z4 repeats (termed 'D4Z4 contraction') on 4q is classified as FSHD1, which accounts for 95% of FSHD cases. Typically, chromosome 4 includes between 11 and 150 D4Z4 repeats. In FSHD1, there are 1–10 D4Z4 repeats. The number of repeats is roughly inversely related to disease severity. Namely, those with 8 - 10 repeats tend to have the mildest presentations, sometimes with no symptoms; those with 4 - 7 repeats have moderate disease that is highly variable; and those with 1 - 3 repeats are more likely to have severe, atypical, and early-onset disease. Deletion of the entire D4Z4 repeat array does not result in FSHD because then there are no complete copies of \"DUX4\" to be expressed, although other birth defects result. One contracted D4Z4 repeat array with an adjoining 4qA allele is sufficient to cause disease, so inheritance is autosomal dominant. \"De novo\" (new) mutations are implicated in 10 - 30% of cases, up to 40% of which exhibit somatic mosaicism. In an individual with mosaic FSHD, the severity of disease is correlated to the proportion of their cells carrying the mutation.","label":"r","PVI":"1.8847911","annotated_label":"w","source":"QACGEN","date":"240318_184020","acceptable_error":false}

In the late 1920s, after he left Freud's inner circle, Rank explored how human beings can learn to assert their will within relationships, and advocated a maximum degree of individuation (or \"difference\") within a maximum degree of connectedness (or \"likeness\").

When they arrived to the scene, a woman standing on the porch began to tell them that she heard glass breaking and that she believed the house next door was being broken into. Officer Hymon went to check, where he saw Edward Garner, who was fleeing the scene. As Garner was climbing over the gate, Hymon called out \"police, halt\", and when Garner failed to do so, Hymon fatally shot Garner in the back of the head, despite being \"reasonably sure\" that Garner was unarmed.

Garner, that deadly force may be used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a serious risk to the officer or to others.\n\nUse of force\n\n\"Payne v.

Tickets were also issued to the underage drinkers. Wilson called the owner of the apartment complex because of the disturbances that were being caused; loud music and the sounds of bottles breaking. Wilson was consented by the complex apartment owner to have non-residents to leave the complex. 30 to 40 officers were rounded up with riot gear - including pepper ball guns - to try to disperse the crowd of 1,000 attendees. The officers gathered in front of the complex where 15 to 20 students, including Timothy C. Nelson, were attempting to leave, but no instructions were given by the police. Officers began to fire pepper-balls, one of which struck Nelson in the eye. He collapsed immediately and was taken to the hospital much later on, where he suffered multiple injuries including temporary blindness and a permanent loss of visual acuity. He endured multiple surgeries to try to repair the injury. Nelson lost his athletic scholarship due to his injury and was forced to withdraw from UC Davis. The officers were unable to find any criminal charges against Nelson.

James relented about the TV special before the 2011–12 season: \"if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it.\" James won two NBA championships with Miami: the first in 2011–12 in his second season with the Heat, and again the following season in 2012–13. By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.","label":"r","PVI":"1.9660115","annotated_label":"r","source":"QACGEN","date":"240319_075306","acceptable_error":false}

{"claim":"Another name for lymphoma is Hodgkin.","context":"Eosinophilia\n\nPathophysiology.\n\nIgE-mediated eosinophil production is induced by compounds released by basophils and mast cells, including eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, leukotriene B4 and serotonin mediated release of eosinophil granules occur, complement complex (C5-C6-C7), interleukin 5, and histamine (though this has a narrow range of concentration).\n\nHarm resulting from untreated eosinophilia potentially varies with cause. During an allergic reaction, the release of histamine from mast cells causes vasodilation which allows eosinophils to migrate from the blood and localize in affected tissues. Accumulation of eosinophils in tissues can be significantly damaging. Eosinophils, like other granulocytes, contain granules (or sacs) filled with digestive enzymes and cytotoxic proteins which under normal conditions are used to destroy parasites but in eosinophilia these agents can damage healthy tissues. In addition to these agents, the granules in eosinophils also contain inflammatory molecules and cytokines which can recruit more eosinophils and other inflammatory cells to the area and hence amplify and perpetuate the damage. This process is generally accepted to be the major inflammatory process in the pathophysiology of atopic or allergic asthma.","label":"n","PVI":"0.80169284","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240319_075320","acceptable_error":false}

Afterwards he studied at the Imperial Academy inNanjing. When Beijing fell in 1644 to rebels, Chenggong and his followers declared their loyalty to the Ming dynasty and he was bestowed the title Guoxingye (Lord of the Imperial surname), pronounced \"Kok seng ia\" in southern Fujianese. His father Zhilong aided the Longwu Emperor in a military expedition in 1646, but Longwu was captured and executed. In November 1646, Zhilong declared his loyalty to the Qing. Chenggong continued the resistance against the Qing from Xiamen. In 1649, Chenggong gained control over Quanzhou but then lost it. In 1650 he planned a major offensive from Guangdong in conjunction with a Ming loyalist in Guangxi. The Qing deployed a large army to the area and Chenggong decided to ferry his army along the coast but a storm hindered his movements.

{"claim":"The sura 7:156 contains the word zakat.","context":"Zakat\n\nSome classical jurists held the view that any Muslim who consciously refuses to pay zakat is an apostate, since the failure to believe that it is a religious duty (\"fard\") is a form of unbelief (\"kufr\"), and should be killed. However, prevailing opinion among classical jurists prescribed sanctions such as fines, imprisonment or corporal punishment. Some classical and contemporary scholars such as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh and Yusuf al-Qaradawi have stated that the person who fails to pay Zakat should have the payment taken from them, along with half of his wealth. Additionally, those who failed to pay the zakat would face God's punishment in the afterlife on the day of Judgment.\n\nZakat\n\nIn modern states where zakat payment is compulsory, failure to pay is regulated by state law similarly to tax evasion.\n\nDistribution.\n\nAccording to the Quran's Surah Al-Tawba, there are eight categories of people (\"asnaf\") who qualify to benefit from zakat funds.\n\n\"Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.\"\n\nIslamic scholars have traditionally interpreted this verse as identifying the following eight categories of Muslim causes to be the proper recipients of zakat:\n\nZakat should not be given to one's own parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, spouses or the descendants of Muhammad.\n\nNeither the Quran nor the Hadiths specify the relative division of zakat into the above eight categories. According to the Reliance of the Traveller, the Shafi'i school requires zakat is to be distributed equally among the eight categories of recipients, while the Hanafi school permits zakat to be distributed to all the categories, some of them, or just one of them. Classical schools of Islamic law, including Shafi'i, are unanimous that collectors of zakat are to be paid first, with the balance to be distributed equally amongst the remaining seven categories of recipients, even in cases where one group's need is more demanding.","label":"n","PVI":"0.06893206","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240319_093136","acceptable_error":false}

Already under heavy pressure on both the left (from Legio X) and right wings (the cavalry charge), they thought Labienus was retreating. The Pompeian legions broke their lines and fled in disorder. Although some were able to find refuge within the walls of Munda, many more were killed in the rout. At the end of the battle there were about 30,000 Pompeians dead on the field; losses on Caesar's side were lighter, about 1,000. All thirteen standards of the Pompeian legions were captured, a sign of complete disbandment. Titus Labienus and Attius Varus died on the field and were granted a burial by Caesar, while Gnaeus Pompeius managed to escape from the battlefield.\n\nBattle of Munda\n\nAftermath.\n\nCaesar left his legate Quintus Fabius Maximus to besiege Munda, and moved to pacify the province. Corduba surrendered: men in arms present in the town (mostly armed slaves) were executed, and the city was forced to pay a heavy indemnity. The city of Munda held out for some time, but, after an unsuccessful attempt to break the siege, surrendered, with 14,000 prisoners taken. Gaius Didius, a naval commander loyal to Caesar, hunted down most of the Pompeian ships. Gnaeus Pompeius looked for refuge on land, but was cornered during the Battle of Lauro and killed.","label":"n","PVI":"-1.0326403","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240319_093434","acceptable_error":false}

But whilst he referred to the earlier school of watercolourists his works are all his own and were created as much as reaction to French Impressionism but with a peculiarly English slant. As Rich and a number of his contemporaries pointed out (including Roger Fry and Lawrence Binyon) it was arguably the English watercolour tradition of painting quickly En plein air that had inspired much of the Impressionism's original spontaneity and it was an area where the English artistic tradition could claim to have been innovative. Rich was an advocate of a natural approach to painting, trying to capture the emotions which a subject provoked, rather than accurately reproducing a scene. He had little feeling towards what he termed \"exhibition pieces\", which he viewed as being overworked. He was critical towards even some of the greatest masters who he believed were often guilty of marring their work by polishing over the traces of their original responses to a scene. He also disliked \"pretty pictures\", a term which he used to refer to the quaint works produced by some of his contemporaries and used this term as a thinly veiled criticism of the work of Helen Allingham.","label":"n","PVI":"0.73571515","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240319_180742","acceptable_error":false}

Western Christians were more skeptical of Pilate; during various periods of persecution by the Roman Empire, Pilate was identified as the first persecutor. Western attitudes softened later in an attempt to show that Christianity need not be feared and that good Romans such as Pilate had acknowledged that Jesus was not a threat to Roman rule, and the Jews were the real problem. After Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Western attitudes toward Pilate became more hostile again, as there was no longer a need to justify to pagan rulers that Christians were harmless and not criminals.","label":"r","PVI":"1.8282288","annotated_label":"r","source":"QACGEN","date":"240319_181317","acceptable_error":false}

During the 8th to 10th centuries the region was in hands of the Bagrationi princes of Tao-Klarjeti under the name of Artaani, and later part of Kingdom of Georgia between 11th to 15th centuries. According to the Arab historian Yahya of Antioch, the Byzantines razed Ardahan and slaughtered its population in 1021.\n\nArdahan\n\nThe Mongols took hold of the city in the 1230s but the Georgian princes of Samtskhe were able to recapture it in 1266.

It was recorded in the months before and after Mingus' death in January 1979 and is wholly dedicated to him. The album is one of Mitchell's most experimental and jazz-centric works. Mingus originally wrote six compositions (entitled \"Joni I-VI\") for Mitchell to write lyrics for; three of these pieces were included on the album. Two other tracks written exclusively by Mitchell are included, alongside a new version of Mingus' standard \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\", featuring lyrics written by Mitchell. In addition to these, five spoken word tracks (denoted as \"raps\") are dispersed throughout the album.\n\nMingus (Joni Mitchell album)\n\nMitchell is backed on the album by Jaco Pastorius (who had also contributed to Mitchell's two previous albums) on fretless bass, Wayne Shorter on saxophone, Herbie Hancock on electric piano, Peter Erskine on drums and Don Alias on percussion. \"Mingus\" received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and peaked at number 17 in the US. \"The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines\" was released as a single to promote the album, but did not chart.

Western Christians were more skeptical of Pilate; during various periods of persecution by the Roman Empire, Pilate was identified as the first persecutor. Western attitudes softened later in an attempt to show that Christianity need not be feared and that good Romans such as Pilate had acknowledged that Jesus was not a threat to Roman rule, and the Jews were the real problem. After Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Western attitudes toward Pilate became more hostile again, as there was no longer a need to justify to pagan rulers that Christians were harmless and not criminals.","label":"s","PVI":"1.337574","annotated_label":"s","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_093818","acceptable_error":false}

{"claim":"Jireček is considered the first known ancestor of the famous five brothers Martinovic from Njegoš's \"Mountain Wreath\".","context":"Orlović clan\n\nAccording to one of the versions of the Orlović family story Jovan Erdeljanović heard in Bajice, four brothers did in fact relocate from Gacko to Cuce. However, they were named as follows: Bajko, Bjelan, Nenoje and Čejo. Bajko remained in Cuce, where his offspring founded the Bajković clan. Bjelan moved to Bjelice, and his descendants founded the modern-day clans of Milići, Abramovići, etc. Nenoje moved to Bajice, where his descendants would later branch off into the Martinović and Vuksanović clans. Čejo returned to Gacko and converted to Islam, effectively creating the Čengić clan. According to this legend, there were three more brothers, who had initially remained in Čarađe. One of the brothers would establish the Samardžić clan in Krivošije. The second brother was the ancestor of the Bandići in Komani, as well as the Đuričići in Zagarač. The third brother converted to Islam and established the prominent Muslim Osmanagić family in Podgorica.\n\nOrlović clan\n\nHowever, Kovijanić considers more probable the version according to which Pavle's so-called \"sons\" were actually his relatives, even though he doesn't elaborate on that at all. On the other hand, when talking about the true timeframe of the migration of the Orlović family, Kovijanić relies exclusively on historical documents, not on oral tradition, which \"popular tradition ties to the fall of Herzegovina (1482). Thus Jireček cites that the first mention of the clan Bjelica in Konavli, region adjacent to Dubrovnik and repossessed by them at that time, dates from 1430 (\"50-60 houses of \"Vlachorum Belize\" from Zeta\") Kovijanić cites a document from the coastal town of Kotor, dated September 1, 1440, that records a money lending contract between Thudor Nenoe Ivanovich from Cetinje and Luka Pautinov from Kotor, whereby Ivanovich promises to repay the sum he lent to buy an armor by Christmas time or with a 20% interest thereafter. Since Ivanovich is a patronymic revealing the name of his grandfather Ivan and father Nenoe, Kovijanić concludes that, given the timeframe, Ivan could well have been a contemporary of the main actors of the Battle of Kosovo, including his relative Pavle Orlović himself, one of the two main characters of the folk epic poem \"The Kosovo Maiden\" It is probably on the basis of this information contrasted with many versions of the story of the family migration and those involved in it which overlap but are not identical, that Kovijanić concludes that it is more likely that the migration did not involve direct offspring of Pavle Orlović but his (many) relatives. Kovijanić also holds that, contrary to Erdeljanović, the toponyms in Bajice that carry the imprint of the old family name Orlović after the immigrants from Čarađe and not after some previous inhabitants of Bajice. In any event, Ivan stands as the first known ancestor of the famous five brothers Martinović from Njegoš's \"Mountain Wreath\".","label":"r","PVI":"1.7515222","annotated_label":"r","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_105403","acceptable_error":false}

It was founded in 1996 by Pakistani cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan, who served as the country's prime minister from 2018 to 2022. The PTI is one of the three major Pakistani political parties alongside the Pakistan Muslim League–Nawaz (PML–N) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), and it is the largest party in terms of representation in the National Assembly of Pakistan since the 2018 general election.

From 1999 to 2007, the PTI supported the military presidency of Pervez Musharraf. It rose in opposition to Musharraf in 2007 and also boycotted the 2008 general election, accusing it of having been conducted with fraudulent procedures under Musharraf's rule. The global popularity of the \"Third Way\" during the Musharraf era led to the rise of a new Pakistani political bloc focused on centrism, deviating from the traditional dominance of the centre-left PPP and the centre-right PML–N. When the PML–Q began to decline in the aftermath of Musharraf's presidency, much of its centrist voter bank was lost to the PTI. Around the same time, the PPP's popularity began to decrease after the disqualification of Yousaf Raza Gillani in 2012. Similarly, the PTI appealed to many former PPP voters, particularly in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, due to its outlook on populism.","label":"n","PVI":"0.22657126","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_105945","acceptable_error":false}

Bjelan moved to Bjelice, and his descendants founded the modern-day clans of Milići, Abramovići, etc. Nenoje moved to Bajice, where his descendants would later branch off into the Martinović and Vuksanović clans. Čejo returned to Gacko and converted to Islam, effectively creating the Čengić clan. According to this legend, there were three more brothers, who had initially remained in Čarađe. One of the brothers would establish the Samardžić clan in Krivošije. The second brother was the ancestor of the Bandići in Komani, as well as the Đuričići in Zagarač.

Thus Jireček cites that the first mention of the clan Bjelica in Konavli, region adjacent to Dubrovnik and repossessed by them at that time, dates from 1430 (\"50-60 houses of \"Vlachorum Belize\" from Zeta\") Kovijanić cites a document from the coastal town of Kotor, dated September 1, 1440, that records a money lending contract between Thudor Nenoe Ivanovich from Cetinje and Luka Pautinov from Kotor, whereby Ivanovich promises to repay the sum he lent to buy an armor by Christmas time or with a 20% interest thereafter. Since Ivanovich is a patronymic revealing the name of his grandfather Ivan and father Nenoe, Kovijanić concludes that, given the timeframe, Ivan could well have been a contemporary of the main actors of the Battle of Kosovo, including his relative Pavle Orlović himself, one of the two main characters of the folk epic poem \"The Kosovo Maiden\" It is probably on the basis of this information contrasted with many versions of the story of the family migration and those involved in it which overlap but are not identical, that Kovijanić concludes that it is more likely that the migration did not involve direct offspring of Pavle Orlović but his (many) relatives. Kovijanić also holds that, contrary to Erdeljanović, the toponyms in Bajice that carry the imprint of the old family name Orlović after the immigrants from Čarađe and not after some previous inhabitants of Bajice. In any event, Ivan stands as the first known ancestor of the famous five brothers Martinović from Njegoš's \"Mountain Wreath\".","label":"s","PVI":"1.6659003","annotated_label":"s","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_111012","acceptable_error":false}

After all, the Romans were nearly always at war during the third century BC. However, it is of course possible that the advent of the new war made an impact. The \"lex Claudia\"'s ulterior purpose might have been to secure private ships for use in the war. The targeted ships were probably large enough to carry the troops and supplies needed for warfare. If so, the law would then serve to aid the equestrians' merchant ambitions, limit the influence of senators and provide commanders with ships large enough to carry troops and supplies.\n\nLex Claudia de nave senatoris\n\nConflict of the Orders.\n\nThe third century BC may have also seen the resurgence of conflicts between the patrician and the plebeian classes.

However, the patrician class, made up of elite families, quickly began to dominate the political scene at the expense of the majority, the plebeians.

They constructed a tower in the center of the convention hall to allow for a better camera shot of the podium, and they exercised more control over camera shots and the conduct of delegates in front of the cameras.","label":"n","PVI":"0.79893816","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_113912","acceptable_error":false}

{"claim":"There are two factors in the production of phytoplankton.","context":"Ecology of the San Francisco Estuary\n\nHerbivory also removes phytoplankton from the water column. While the pelagic food web is based upon phytoplankton production, most of this production is diverted to the benthos via predation by the introduced Amur River clam (\"Corbula amurensis\"). Levels of phytoplankton biomass declined by an order of magnitude after the widespread introduction of \"C. amurensis\" in the mid-1980s, and have not rebounded.\n\nEcology of the San Francisco Estuary\n\nPhotosynthetic production.\n\nThe main source of photosynthetically derived energy is phytoplankton. Generally speaking, diatoms and microflagellates produce most of the bioavailable carbon in the estuary. Other types, notably the dinoflagellates, may produce harmful algal blooms, or red tides, that are less readily available for assimilation into the foodweb.\n\nEcology of the San Francisco Estuary\n\nPrimary production from phytoplankton is a function of two different factors: growth rates and accumulation (Fig. 1). Although the LSZ is a sink for high concentrations of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources, phytoplankton production rates are quite low. Nitrate is optimally used by phytoplankton for growth, but ammonium (largely derived from sewage outfalls) has a suppressive effect on growth rate. Thus, while not nutrient-limited, phytoplankton tend to grow more slowly due to the kinds of nitrogen present. Another suppressive factor on growth rate is the high turbidity of the estuary, which limits the ability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to penetrate beyond the top few centimeters of the water column. This limits phytoplankton photosynthesis to a relatively shallow photic zone. Thus, when the water column is stratified, turbidity is high, and ammonium is present, the growth rate of phytoplankton is typically suppressed.","label":"s","PVI":"1.670845","annotated_label":"s","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_121912","acceptable_error":false}

Cleaner fish are mutually beneficial to many other species, which allows them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (\"Labroides dimidiatus\"), is the model of a mimic, the sabre-toothed blenny (\"Aspidontus taeniatus\"). The cleaner wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus \"Epinephelus\", resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognised by other fishes who allow it to clean them. The blenny lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like the cleaner wrasse in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner wrasse's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, the sabre-toothed blenny bites it, tearing off scales or pieces of fin. Fish grazed upon in this fashion learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because of the similarity between the two, they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, down to the regional level.","label":"n","PVI":"-0.006319642","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_123118","acceptable_error":false}

{"claim":"Clement VIII recalled the Sixtine Vulgate in 1602.","context":"Sixtine Vulgate\n\nAfter Sixtus V's death, Robert Bellarmine wrote a letter in 1602 to Clement VIII trying to dissuade him from resolving the question of the \"auxiliis divinae gratiae\" by himself. In his letter Bellarmine wrote concerning the Sixtine Vulgate: \"Your Holiness also knows in what danger Sixtus V put himself and put the whole Church, by trying to correct the Bible according to his own judgment: and for me I really do not know if there has ever been greater danger\".\n\nSixtine Vulgate\n\nRecall of the Sixtine Vulgate.\n\nIn January 1592, almost immediately after his election, Clement VIII recalled all copies of the Sixtine Vulgate as one of his first acts. The reason invoked for recalling Sixtus V's edition was printing errors, although the Sixtine Vulgate was mostly free of them.\n\nSixtine Vulgate\n\nAccording to James Hastings, Clement VIII's \"personal hostility\" toward Sixtus and his belief that the Sixtine Vulgate was not \"a worthy representative of the Vulgate text\" were the reasons behind the recall. Eberhard Nestle suggests that the revocation was really due to the influence of the Jesuits, whom Sixtus had offended by putting one of Bellarmine's books on the Index Librorum prohibitorum. Kenyon writes that the Sixtine Vulgate was \"full of errors\", but that Clement VIII was also motivated in his decision to recall the edition by the Jesuits, \"whom Sixtus had offended\". Sixtus regarded the Jesuits with disfavour and suspicion. He considered making radical changes to their constitution, but his death prevented this from being carried out. Sixtus V objected to some of the Jesuits' rules and especially to the title \"Society of Jesus\". He was at the point of changing these when he died. Sixtus V \"had some conflict with the Society of Jesus more generally, especially regarding the Society's concept of blind obedience to the General, which for Sixtus and other important figures of the Roman Curia jeopardized the preeminence of the role of the pope within the Church\". Jaroslav Pelikan, without giving any more details, says that the Sixtine Vulgate \"proved to be so defective that it was withdrawn\".","label":"r","PVI":"1.9797275","annotated_label":"r","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_123737","acceptable_error":false}

Tim told Ricky he didn't ever want to hear Phyllis's name again, but Ricky was able to convince Tim to tell him about his history with Phyllis, and he then stole Phyllis' therapy file from his apartment. Tim then told Ricky to look into the events of Christmas 1994, when Phyllis ran over Christine Blair and Ricky's father Paul Williams with her car. Afterward, Tim was reported missing and the news hit Genoa City, earning the attention of Paul and Phyllis' sister, Avery. Phyllis later told Avery that she paid Tim to leave town permanently to cover up the hit-and-run incident from eighteen years earlier. His neighbor Beth placed a call to him and he was seen on some sort of vacation, informing him of recent developments about Phyllis. Ronan Malloy, by tapping into Beth's phone records, then discovered Dr. Tim and brought him back to Genoa City where he, along with Michael Baldwin and Heather Stevens, questioned him. He revealed that Phyllis paid him to get out of town to keep her secrets safe. As a favor to Heather, who was also Ricky's sister, he talked to Paul about his son and his character. Tim then revealed to Phyllis that he had a recording of her admitting to the hit and run during a therapy session, and begun to blackmail her again by making her transfer large sums of money into an offshore bank account. Despite having the money, all Tim really wanted was a sexual encounter with Phyllis. She became so desperate that she had to tap into her daughter's trust find, leading her husband, Nicholas Newman, to find out what she had done and her sister quit as her legal counsel. Even as Nick told her by giving in to Tim's blackmail she strengthened the prosecution's case, she agreed to spending an evening with him as a final option to keep him quiet. Her plan was not to sleep with Tim, but drug him to fall asleep so he would believe they did. Unbeknownst to Phyllis, before she could drug him, Tim took a large amount of erectile dysfunction pills, which made him have a heart attack and die in front of her. Afterward, Phyllis enlisted the help of Kevin Fisher to dispose of Tim's body at his apartment, to make it look like he died whilst at home.","label":"r","PVI":"1.6506705","annotated_label":"r","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_130128","acceptable_error":false}

After all, the Romans were nearly always at war during the third century BC. However, it is of course possible that the advent of the new war made an impact. The \"lex Claudia\"'s ulterior purpose might have been to secure private ships for use in the war. The targeted ships were probably large enough to carry the troops and supplies needed for warfare. If so, the law would then serve to aid the equestrians' merchant ambitions, limit the influence of senators and provide commanders with ships large enough to carry troops and supplies.\n\nLex Claudia de nave senatoris\n\nConflict of the Orders.\n\nThe third century BC may have also seen the resurgence of conflicts between the patrician and the plebeian classes. When the Roman Republic (\"res publica\") was founded in 509 BC, it attempted to readjust the balance of power in favour of the people. However, the patrician class, made up of elite families, quickly began to dominate the political scene at the expense of the majority, the plebeians. The conflicts between the patricians and plebeians came to be known as the Conflict of the Orders. By 290 BC these conflicts largely came to an end when plebeian consuls were introduced. However, patrician\/plebeian issues still surfaced from time-to-time in the later Republic. Although the most well-documented example of this conflict arose around the Gracchi (133\/123 BC), it is possible that the passage of the \"lex Claudia\" may also be an example of this continuing theme.","label":"r","PVI":"1.7795902","annotated_label":"w","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_130441","acceptable_error":false}

The figure is naked except for a horizontally drawn loincloth. He is obviously dead: his eyes are closed, his head droops to the right, the body is rigid; his ribs are extended and the chest is flat. He has thick flat-topped hair formed from a cap-like moulding with vertical groves to indicate hair strands. The elements of his head and face are incised into the bronze, and are in good condition although his ears are missing. His chest is outlined by a differentiated surface, his ribs and nipples are represented by impressions, and his navel by a deep-cut incision. His legs are crossed and lined with incisions to indicate toes.\n\nCorp Naomh\n\nThe hands were at some point lost and replaced with crudely described rods. The horizontal design above his head is badly damaged and may have once been either a crown or a band of hair. The surrounding plating is 10th-century but is mostly lost. Equally the bronze backing, also 10th-century, is severely damaged especially on the lower right-hand side.","label":"n","PVI":"0.7867559","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_131443","acceptable_error":false}

{"claim":"Estes Kefauver was a candidate for the 1952 Democratic National Convention.","context":"1952 Democratic National Convention\n\nThe 1952 Republican National Convention had been held two weeks before the Democratic convention television, from July 7–11. During the Republican convention, cameras were restricted to the sides of the floor which did not allow for close, clear shots. The Democrats took note of what did and did not work at the Republican convention. They constructed a tower in the center of the floor for television cameras to capture better quality shots of the podium. Party officials closely monitored the camera angles during proceedings to exercise control over shots. Before the convention, party officials instructed delegates to conduct themselves professionally during the convention as the cameras were broadcasting their actions to millions. From the Democratic and Republican conventions of 1952 emerged the precedent of orchestrating American national party conventions as made-for-TV events.\n\n1952 Democratic National Convention\n\nTelevision coverage.\n\nThe 1952 Democratic convention was the second political convention to be televised live, coast-to-coast (following the Republican Convention weeks earlier). Experiments in regionally broadcasting conventions took place during the Democratic and Republican conventions in 1948, however 1952 was the first year in which networks carried nationwide coverage of political conventions. After carefully watching the Republican Convention, the Democratic Party made last-minute alterations to their convention held in the same venue to make its broadcast more appealing to television audiences. They constructed a tower in the center of the convention hall to allow for a better camera shot of the podium, and they exercised more control over camera shots and the conduct of delegates in front of the cameras.","label":"n","PVI":"0.19970477","annotated_label":"n","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_131723","acceptable_error":false}
{"claim":"The origin of the Kroazę family was French.","context":"Romualdas Marcinkus\n\nMarcinkus was seldom mentioned during the Cold War and his pre-war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press, particularly in the US. During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus began to appear in these newspapers, including \"Karys\", \"Vienas iš daugelio\" (1950), \"Paskutinis žuvusiojo lakūno atvirukas\" (1955), and \"Kapitono Marcinkaus mirtis nelaisvėje\" (1956).

Thereinafter Marcinkus's life was more frequently mentioned, although much of the information presented was inaccurate and incomplete.\n\nRomualdas Marcinkus\n\nAfter Lithuania successfully re-established its independence, interest in his story gained momentum in Lithuania and elsewhere. In Jurbarkas, a street was named after him. The Lithuanian Air Force now sponsors the \"Marcinkus Pistol Marksmanship Cup\". In 2001 the British Ambassador in Vilnius gave Marcinkus' previously unclaimed war medals to a surviving relative, his nephew, Alvydas Gabėnas, during a commemorative ceremony. The RAF provided a fly-past of Harrier jets from Marcinkus' No. 1 Squadron RAF, in which one aircraft saluted the ceremony. In the same year a plaque was dedicated to honour the famous Lithuanian pilot in Kaunas. Gražina Sviderskytė, a CNN award-winning journalist, wrote a detailed account of Marcinkus' life in her book \"Uragano kapitonas\" (\"Hurricane Captain\"), which was published in 2004.

{"claim":"Sixtus V thought the concept of blind obedience to the General jeopardized the preeminence of the role of the pope within the Church.","context":"Sixtine Vulgate\n\nAfter Sixtus V's death, Robert Bellarmine wrote a letter in 1602 to Clement VIII trying to dissuade him from resolving the question of the \"auxiliis divinae gratiae\" by himself. In his letter Bellarmine wrote concerning the Sixtine Vulgate: \"Your Holiness also knows in what danger Sixtus V put himself and put the whole Church, by trying to correct the Bible according to his own judgment: and for me I really do not know if there has ever been greater danger\".\n\nSixtine Vulgate\n\nRecall of the Sixtine Vulgate.\n\nIn January 1592, almost immediately after his election, Clement VIII recalled all copies of the Sixtine Vulgate as one of his first acts. The reason invoked for recalling Sixtus V's edition was printing errors, although the Sixtine Vulgate was mostly free of them.\n\nSixtine Vulgate\n\nAccording to James Hastings, Clement VIII's \"personal hostility\" toward Sixtus and his belief that the Sixtine Vulgate was not \"a worthy representative of the Vulgate text\" were the reasons behind the recall. Eberhard Nestle suggests that the revocation was really due to the influence of the Jesuits, whom Sixtus had offended by putting one of Bellarmine's books on the Index Librorum prohibitorum. Kenyon writes that the Sixtine Vulgate was \"full of errors\", but that Clement VIII was also motivated in his decision to recall the edition by the Jesuits, \"whom Sixtus had offended\". Sixtus regarded the Jesuits with disfavour and suspicion. He considered making radical changes to their constitution, but his death prevented this from being carried out. Sixtus V objected to some of the Jesuits' rules and especially to the title \"Society of Jesus\". He was at the point of changing these when he died. Sixtus V \"had some conflict with the Society of Jesus more generally, especially regarding the Society's concept of blind obedience to the General, which for Sixtus and other important figures of the Roman Curia jeopardized the preeminence of the role of the pope within the Church\". Jaroslav Pelikan, without giving any more details, says that the Sixtine Vulgate \"proved to be so defective that it was withdrawn\".","label":"r","PVI":"-0.34183133","annotated_label":"w","source":"QACGEN","date":"240320_131901","acceptable_error":false}
